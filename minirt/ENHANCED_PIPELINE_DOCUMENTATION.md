# Introduction & Prerequisites

Welcome to the Enhanced MiniRT Raytracing Documentation! This guide is designed for absolute beginners—even if you have never studied trigonometry or algebra before. We'll break down every concept step by step, using simple language, analogies, and hands-on examples.

## What is Raytracing?
Raytracing is a way for computers to create realistic images by simulating how light travels and bounces off objects. Imagine shining a flashlight in a dark room: the light travels in straight lines (rays), bounces off walls and objects, and eventually reaches your eyes. Raytracing does the same thing, but with math!

## Why Do We Need Math?
To figure out where the light goes, we need to describe things like:
- Where objects are (points in 3D space)
- Which way things are pointing (vectors)
- How far things are from each other (distance)
- How light bounces (angles, directions)

Don't worry if these words sound new—we'll explain everything from scratch!

## How to Use This Guide
- Read each section in order. Each part builds on the last.
- Try the hands-on exercises as you go—they'll help you understand the ideas.
- Check the glossary if you see a word you don't know.

## Glossary (Quick Reference)
- **Point**: A location in space, like a dot on a piece of paper, but in 3D.
- **Vector**: An arrow with a direction and a length (how far, and which way).
- **Ray**: Like a laser beam—starts at a point and goes forever in one direction.
- **Dot Product**: A way to measure how much two arrows point in the same direction.
- **Cross Product**: A way to find a new arrow that is at a right angle to two others.
- **Normalization**: Making an arrow exactly 1 unit long (not changing its direction).
- **Intersection**: The point where two things (like a ray and a sphere) meet.
- **Ambient Light**: The general light in a room, not coming from any one place.
- **Diffuse Light**: Light that hits a surface directly, like sunlight on your face.
- **Attenuation**: How light gets dimmer as it travels farther.
- **Epsilon**: A tiny number used to say "close enough" when comparing numbers.

# Basic Math Concepts for Beginners

Before we dive into raytracing, let's get comfortable with the basic math ideas you'll see everywhere in this guide. We'll use simple analogies and diagrams to make things clear!

## What is a Point?
A **point** is just a location in space. Imagine a tiny dot floating in the air. In 3D, we write its position as (x, y, z). For example, (2, 3, 5) means:
- 2 steps to the right
- 3 steps up
- 5 steps forward

## What is a Vector?
A **vector** is like an arrow. It has:
- A direction (which way it points)
- A length (how far it goes)

Think of a vector as "go 3 steps right, 4 steps up, 0 steps forward." We write this as (3, 4, 0).

### Visualizing a Vector
```
Start at (0,0,0), go 3 right, 4 up:

   ^ y
   |
 4 +
   |
   |
   +------> x
      3
```

## What is a Ray?
A **ray** is like a laser beam:
- It starts at a point (the origin)
- It goes in a direction (the vector)
- It keeps going forever (unless it hits something)

## What is the Dot Product?
The **dot product** is a way to measure how much two vectors point in the same direction.
- If they point the same way, the dot product is big and positive.
- If they are at a right angle, the dot product is zero.
- If they point opposite ways, the dot product is negative.

**Analogy:** Imagine shining a flashlight along one arrow. The dot product tells you how much light lands on the other arrow.

## What is the Cross Product?
The **cross product** gives you a new vector that is at a right angle (perpendicular) to both input vectors.
- If you have two arrows on the floor, the cross product points straight up from the floor.

**Analogy:** If you point your right hand's fingers along the first vector and curl them toward the second, your thumb points in the direction of the cross product.

## What is Normalization?
**Normalization** means making a vector exactly 1 unit long, but keeping its direction the same.
- If your arrow is too long or too short, normalization stretches or shrinks it to length 1.

**Why do we normalize?**
- It makes calculations simpler and more predictable.
- Many formulas in raytracing expect vectors to be normalized.

# Camera & Ray Generation (Step-by-Step for Beginners)

Let's see how we turn a pixel on your screen into a 3D ray in the world. We'll use lots of analogies and a real example!

## What is the Field of View (FOV)?
Imagine looking through a window. The FOV is how wide the window is—how much you can see from left to right. A wide window (big FOV) lets you see more; a narrow window (small FOV) lets you see less.

- **Wide FOV**: Like a GoPro camera—shows a lot, but things look smaller.
- **Narrow FOV**: Like a telescope—shows a small area, but zoomed in.

## Step 1: Calculate the Pixel Scale
We need to know how much moving one pixel on the screen changes the direction of our ray in 3D.

- We use the formula: `pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)`
- This tells us: "If I move one pixel, how much does my view shift in the 3D world?"

## Step 2: Center the Pixel Coordinates
Computer screens start at the top-left (0,0), but we want the center to be (0,0) for our math.
- `u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale` (right/left)
- `v = (HEIGHT/2 - y) * pixel_scale` (up/down)

## Step 3: Build the 3D Ray Direction
We combine the camera's right, up, and forward directions:
- `direction = normalize(Right × u + Up × v + Forward)`

**Analogy:**
- Imagine standing at the center of a room, looking forward.
- To look at a pixel to the right, you turn your head right (add Right × u).
- To look at a pixel up, you tilt your head up (add Up × v).
- You always start by looking straight ahead (Forward).

## Real-World Example
Suppose:
- Screen size: 800 × 600 pixels
- FOV: 90°
- You click on pixel (600, 150)

**Step 1:** Calculate pixel_scale
- tan(45°) = 1
- pixel_scale = 1 / 400 = 0.0025

**Step 2:** Center the coordinates
- u = (600 - 400) × 0.0025 = 0.5
- v = (300 - 150) × 0.0025 = 0.375

**Step 3:** Build the direction
- direction = normalize(Right × 0.5 + Up × 0.375 + Forward)

**Diagram:**
```
Screen (top view):

   0,0 +-------------------+
       |                   |
       |         *         |  <-- center (400,300)
       |                   |
       +-------------------+
           800,600

Click at (600,150):
- 200 pixels right of center
- 150 pixels up from center
```

**Key Takeaway:**
Every pixel on the screen becomes a unique direction in 3D space. By following these steps, we can figure out exactly where to send our "laser beam" (ray) for each pixel!

## Mathematical Foundations Explained from First Principles

### 0. Prerequisites: Basic Concepts You Need to Know

#### What is a Vector?
A **vector** is simply a direction and distance in space. Think of it as an arrow:
- **Position Vector**: Points from origin (0,0,0) to a location, like (3,4,5)
- **Direction Vector**: Shows which way something is pointing, like (1,0,0) means "pointing right"
- **Length/Magnitude**: How long the vector is, calculated as √(x² + y² + z²)

#### Vector Operations (The Building Blocks)
1. **Addition**: (a,b,c) + (x,y,z) = (a+x, b+y, c+z)
   - Like walking: first go (3,4,0), then go (1,-2,0), you end up at (4,2,0)

2. **Scalar Multiplication**: k × (x,y,z) = (k×x, k×y, k×z)
   - Like stretching: 2 × (1,2,3) = (2,4,6) makes the vector twice as long

3. **Dot Product**: A·B = Ax×Bx + Ay×By + Az×Bz
   - Measures how "similar" two directions are
   - Result = 0 means perpendicular, positive means same general direction

4. **Cross Product**: A×B gives a vector perpendicular to both A and B
   - Used to find "up" direction when you know "forward" and "right"

5. **Normalization**: normalize(V) = V / |V| (makes length = 1)
   - Like keeping the direction but making the arrow exactly 1 unit long

### 1. What is a Ray? (The Foundation of Everything)

#### Intuitive Understanding
Imagine you're holding a laser pointer. The laser beam is a **ray**:
- It starts at your finger (the **origin**)
- It goes in a straight line (the **direction**)
- It extends infinitely far (unless it hits something)

#### Mathematical Definition
A ray is mathematically written as:
```
R(t) = O + t × D
```

**Breaking this down step by step:**
- **O** = Starting point (origin) - like (camera_x, camera_y, camera_z)
- **D** = Direction vector - like (0.5, 0.3, 0.8) means "go right-ish, up-ish, forward-ish"
- **t** = How far along the ray (t=0 is at start, t=1 is one unit away, etc.)
- **R(t)** = The actual point in 3D space at distance t

**Real Example:**
If camera is at (0,0,0) and direction is (1,0,0), then:
- R(0) = (0,0,0) + 0×(1,0,0) = (0,0,0) - still at camera
- R(1) = (0,0,0) + 1×(1,0,0) = (1,0,0) - one unit to the right
- R(5) = (0,0,0) + 5×(1,0,0) = (5,0,0) - five units to the right

### 2. Camera Mathematics: From Screen Pixels to 3D Rays

#### The Problem We're Solving
You click on pixel (100, 200) on your screen. But your 3D world doesn't know about "pixels" - it knows about 3D coordinates. We need to convert that pixel into a ray shooting into the 3D world.

#### Step 1: Understanding Field of View (FOV) - The Complete Picture

**What does FOV mean in everyday terms?**
Imagine you're looking through a camera or your eyes. The Field of View (FOV) is how much you can see from side to side—like the width of your vision.

**Examples to visualize:**
- **Human eyes**: ~180° FOV (we can see almost behind us)
- **Normal camera**: ~50-70° FOV (like a standard lens)
- **Telephoto lens**: ~20-30° FOV (zoomed in, narrow view)
- **Wide-angle lens**: ~90-120° FOV (very wide view)

**Visualizing the Camera View as a Triangle**
Think of the camera as being at the tip of a triangle:
- The triangle opens up in front of the camera, showing what it can see
- The angle at the tip is the FOV (for example, 90°)
- The wider the angle, the more you can see

**Where does tan(FOV/2) come from? - Step by Step**

Let's draw this triangle in text:
```
      /|
     / |
    /  | <--- This is a right triangle!
   /   |
  /FOV/2
 /_____|
camera  distance = 1
```

**Step 1: Split the problem in half**
- The full FOV forms a triangle that opens left and right
- If we split this in half, we get a right triangle on one side
- The angle at the camera corner is now FOV/2 (half the full angle)

**Step 2: Set up the right triangle**
- **Camera position**: at the corner (0,0)
- **Straight ahead**: goes distance 1 forward (this is the "adjacent" side)
- **To the edge**: goes sideways to the edge of view (this is the "opposite" side)

**Step 3: Use trigonometry**
In any right triangle, the tangent function connects angles to side lengths:
```
tan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side
```

In our camera triangle:
- **angle** = FOV/2
- **adjacent side** = 1 (distance straight ahead)
- **opposite side** = how far we can see sideways (the "half-width")

So:
```
tan(FOV/2) = half-width / 1
=> half-width = tan(FOV/2)
```

**Why this is useful:**
- tan(FOV/2) tells us how "wide" the camera can see on ONE side
- At distance 1, if FOV = 90°, then tan(45°) = 1, so we can see 1 unit to each side
- At distance 1, if FOV = 60°, then tan(30°) ≈ 0.577, so we can see 0.577 units to each side

**Real Example with Numbers:**
```
FOV = 90°  => tan(45°) = 1.0     => Can see ±1.0 units at distance 1
FOV = 60°  => tan(30°) = 0.577   => Can see ±0.577 units at distance 1  
FOV = 120° => tan(60°) = 1.732   => Can see ±1.732 units at distance 1
```

**Key insight for beginners:**
- Split the FOV angle in half to work with right triangles
- Use tangent to convert the angle to actual distances
- tan(FOV/2) = how far sideways you can see, if looking straight ahead at distance 1

#### Step 2: Camera Coordinate System - Building Your Own 3D Compass

**The fundamental problem:** 
Your camera might be looking in any direction—not just straight ahead. Maybe it's tilted, rotated, or pointing diagonally. How do we define "left," "right," and "up" for a camera that could be oriented anywhere?

**Real-world analogy:**
Imagine you're a photographer. When you hold your camera:
- You know which way you're pointing (that's **Forward**)
- You need to know which way is "left" and "right" from your perspective (that's **Right**)
- You need to know which way is "up" from your camera's viewpoint (that's **Up**)

**The mathematical solution - step by step:**

**Step 1: Start with what we know**
```
Forward = normalize(camera.orientation)  // Where the camera is looking
World_Up = (0, 1, 0)                    // "Up" in the world (always points to sky)
```

**Step 2: Find the "Right" direction using cross product**
```
Right = normalize(Forward × World_Up)
```

**What does the cross product do?**
Think of cross product as "give me a direction perpendicular to both inputs":
- Input 1: **Forward** (where camera looks)
- Input 2: **World_Up** (world's up direction)
- Output: A direction perpendicular to both = the camera's **Right** direction

**Visual example:**
```
If Forward = (0, 0, 1) [looking along Z-axis]
And World_Up = (0, 1, 0) [Y-axis points up]
Then Forward × World_Up = (1, 0, 0) [X-axis points right]
```

**Step 3: Find the camera's "Up" direction**
```
Up = Right × Forward
```

**Why do we need another cross product?**
- The world's "up" might not be the camera's "up" (if camera is tilted)
- We need the camera's actual "up" direction
- Right × Forward gives us a vector perpendicular to both Right and Forward
- This is the camera's true "up" direction

**Complete example with a tilted camera:**
```
// Camera looking diagonally up and right
Forward = normalize(0.5, 0.5, 0.707)  // Diagonal direction
World_Up = (0, 1, 0)                  // World up (Y-axis)

// Calculate Right direction
Right = normalize(Forward × World_Up)
Right = normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.707) × (0, 1, 0))
Right = normalize((0.707, 0, -0.5))   // Points to camera's right

// Calculate camera's Up direction  
Up = Right × Forward
Up = (0.707, 0, -0.5) × (0.5, 0.5, 0.707)
Up = (0.354, -0.707, 0.354)          // Camera's actual up direction
```

**Why this coordinate system works:**
1. **Right** is perpendicular to both Forward and World_Up
2. **Up** is perpendicular to both Right and Forward  
3. **Forward**, **Right**, and **Up** form a "orthonormal basis" (all perpendicular, all length 1)
4. This gives us a complete 3D coordinate system for the camera

**Key insight:**
Cross product A×B always gives a vector perpendicular to both A and B. We use this twice to build a complete coordinate system from just one direction (where the camera looks).

#### Step 3: Pixel to Ray Conversion - The Magic Translation

**The big picture problem:**
You have a 2D screen with pixels, but you need to shoot 3D rays into a 3D world. How do you convert a pixel coordinate like (150, 200) into a 3D direction like (0.3, 0.1, 0.9)?

**The step-by-step process:**

**Formula breakdown:**
```
pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)
u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale  
v = (HEIGHT/2 - y) * pixel_scale
ray.direction = normalize(Right×u + Up×v + Forward)
```

**Step 1: Understanding pixel_scale**
```
pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)
```

**What does this do?**
- We know `tan(FOV/2)` tells us how far we can see sideways at distance 1
- `WIDTH/2` is how many pixels from center to edge of screen
- So `pixel_scale` converts "one pixel distance" into "3D world distance"

**Example with numbers:**
```
FOV = 90°, so tan(45°) = 1.0
WIDTH = 800 pixels, so WIDTH/2 = 400 pixels
pixel_scale = 1.0 / 400 = 0.0025

This means: moving 1 pixel on screen = moving 0.0025 units in 3D world
```

**Step 2: Center the pixel coordinates**
```
u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale
v = (HEIGHT/2 - y) * pixel_scale
```

**Why subtract WIDTH/2 and HEIGHT/2?**
- Pixel (0,0) is usually at top-left corner of screen
- But we want pixel (0,0) to be at the CENTER of our view
- Subtracting WIDTH/2 makes the center pixel have coordinate 0

**Example transformation:**
```
Screen size: 800×600 pixels
Center pixel: (400, 300)

For pixel (500, 200):
u = (500 - 400) * 0.0025 = 100 * 0.0025 = 0.25
v = (300 - 200) * 0.0025 = 100 * 0.0025 = 0.25

This means: pixel (500,200) is 0.25 units right and 0.25 units up from center
```

**Why is v calculated as (HEIGHT/2 - y) instead of (y - HEIGHT/2)?**
- Computer screens have Y=0 at the TOP
- But 3D worlds usually have Y=0 at the BOTTOM  
- We flip it so "up" on screen means "up" in 3D world

**Step 3: Build the 3D ray direction**
```
ray.direction = normalize(Right×u + Up×v + Forward)
```

**What does this vector addition mean?**
Think of it as giving directions:
- Start by going **Forward** (straight ahead)
- Then go **Right** by amount `u` (positive u = more right, negative u = more left)
- Then go **Up** by amount `v` (positive v = more up, negative v = more down)

**Detailed example:**
```
Forward = (0, 0, 1)    // Looking along Z-axis
Right = (1, 0, 0)      // X-axis points right  
Up = (0, 1, 0)         // Y-axis points up
u = 0.25               // Slightly to the right
v = 0.25               // Slightly up

ray.direction = Right×0.25 + Up×0.25 + Forward×1
              = (1,0,0)×0.25 + (0,1,0)×0.25 + (0,0,1)×1
              = (0.25, 0, 0) + (0, 0.25, 0) + (0, 0, 1)
              = (0.25, 0.25, 1)

After normalize: (0.25, 0.25, 1) / length = (0.24, 0.24, 0.97)
```

**Step 4: Why do we normalize?**
- The vector (0.25, 0.25, 1) has length √(0.25² + 0.25² + 1²) ≈ 1.06
- For ray calculations, we need direction vectors with length exactly 1
- normalize() scales the vector so its length becomes 1, but keeps the same direction

**The complete pixel-to-ray example:**
```
Screen: 800×600, FOV = 90°, click pixel (600, 150)

Step 1: Calculate pixel_scale
pixel_scale = tan(45°) / 400 = 1.0 / 400 = 0.0025

Step 2: Convert to centered coordinates  
u = (600 - 400) × 0.0025 = 0.5        // Half-way to right edge
v = (300 - 150) × 0.0025 = 0.375      // 3/8 of the way up

Step 3: Build direction vector
direction = (1,0,0)×0.5 + (0,1,0)×0.375 + (0,0,1)×1
          = (0.5, 0.375, 1)

Step 4: Normalize
length = √(0.5² + 0.375² + 1²) = √1.390625 ≈ 1.179
normalized = (0.5/1.179, 0.375/1.179, 1/1.179) = (0.424, 0.318, 0.848)

Final ray: origin=(camera_pos), direction=(0.424, 0.318, 0.848)
```

**Key insights for beginners:**
1. **pixel_scale** converts screen distances to world distances
2. **Centering** makes calculations simpler and more intuitive
3. **Vector addition** combines "forward + right + up" movements
4. **Normalization** ensures all rays have the same "speed" (length 1)

## Ray-Object Intersection Mathematics

### 3. Sphere Intersection: The Complete Derivation

#### What is a Sphere?
A sphere is all points that are exactly the same distance from a center point.
- Center at (2,3,4) with radius 5 means every point is exactly distance 5 from (2,3,4)

#### Sphere Equation Derivation
**Distance formula** between two points P and C:
```
distance = √[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²]
```

For a sphere, this distance equals the radius:
```
√[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²] = r
```

**Square both sides** to eliminate the square root:
```
(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)² = r²
```

**Vector notation**: If P is position and C is center, then (P-C) is vector from center to point:
```
|P - C|² = r²
```

#### Ray-Sphere Intersection Derivation
**The question:** Where does ray R(t) = O + t×D hit the sphere?

**Step 1:** Substitute the ray equation into sphere equation
```
|R(t) - C|² = r²
|(O + t×D) - C|² = r²
|(O - C) + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 2:** Let oc = O - C (vector from sphere center to ray origin)
```
|oc + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 3:** Expand the squared magnitude
The magnitude squared |A|² means A·A (dot product with itself):
```
(oc + t×D)·(oc + t×D) = r²
```

**Step 4:** Expand the dot product using distributive property
```
oc·oc + oc·(t×D) + (t×D)·oc + (t×D)·(t×D) = r²
```

**Step 5:** Simplify using dot product properties
- Dot product is commutative: oc·(t×D) = (t×D)·oc
- Scalar can move outside: (t×D)·(t×D) = t²×(D·D)
```
oc·oc + 2t×(oc·D) + t²×(D·D) = r²
```

**Step 6:** Rearrange into standard quadratic form At² + Bt + C = 0
```
(D·D)t² + 2(oc·D)t + (oc·oc - r²) = 0
```

**The coefficients are:**
- **a = D·D** (usually = 1 since D is normalized)
- **b = 2(oc·D)** 
- **c = oc·oc - r²**

#### Solving the Quadratic Equation
**Standard formula:** For At² + Bt + C = 0, solutions are:
```
t = (-B ± √(B² - 4AC)) / 2A
```

**The discriminant Δ = B² - 4AC tells us:**
- **Δ < 0**: No real solutions (ray misses sphere)
- **Δ = 0**: One solution (ray touches sphere at one point)
- **Δ > 0**: Two solutions (ray enters and exits sphere)

**Optimization insight:** We can check if B² < 4AC before doing expensive √ calculation!

#### Computing the Surface Normal
**At intersection point P, the normal is:**
```
N = normalize(P - C)
```

**Why?** The normal is the direction pointing "outward" from the sphere surface. Since every point on a sphere is the same distance from center, the outward direction is simply (point - center).

**Direction check:** Make sure normal points away from the ray:
```
if N·D > 0:  // dot product positive means same direction
    N = -N   // flip it
```

### 4. Plane Intersection: Simple Linear Mathematics

#### What is a Plane?
A plane is a flat surface extending infinitely in all directions. Think of:
- A tabletop extended forever
- A wall that goes on infinitely
- The floor of a room, but infinite

#### Plane Equation Derivation
**Method 1 - Point and Normal:**
If you know:
- One point P₀ on the plane
- The normal vector N (perpendicular to the plane)

Then any point P is on the plane if:
```
(P - P₀)·N = 0
```

**Why?** (P - P₀) is a vector from the known point to any point on the plane. If this vector is perpendicular to the normal (dot product = 0), then P is on the plane.

#### Ray-Plane Intersection Derivation
**Substitute ray equation R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
((O + t×D) - P₀)·N = 0
(O - P₀ + t×D)·N = 0
(O - P₀)·N + t×(D·N) = 0
```

**Solve for t:**
```
t×(D·N) = -(O - P₀)·N
t×(D·N) = (P₀ - O)·N
t = (P₀ - O)·N / (D·N)
```

**Special cases:**
- **If D·N ≈ 0:** Ray is parallel to plane (no intersection or infinite intersections)
- **If t < 0:** Intersection is behind the ray origin (not visible)
- **If t ≥ 0:** Valid intersection at distance t

### 5. Cylinder Intersection: Projections and Quadratics

#### Understanding Cylinders
A cylinder is like a circle "stretched" along an axis:
- **Infinite cylinder:** Like a pipe extending forever in both directions
- **Finite cylinder:** Like a actual pipe with top and bottom caps

#### The Mathematical Challenge
**Problem:** A cylinder isn't centered at origin and isn't aligned with coordinate axes.

**Solution:** Use vector projections to work in "cylinder coordinates."

#### Cylinder Equation Derivation
**For infinite cylinder:**
- **Axis:** Line through point C in direction V (normalized)
- **Radius:** r

**Key insight:** Distance from any point P to the axis line must equal r.

**Step 1:** Find vector from axis point C to our point P:
```
CP = P - C
```

**Step 2:** Project this vector onto the axis to find the "axis component":
```
axis_component = (CP·V) × V
```
This is how much of CP goes along the axis direction.

**Step 3:** The remaining part is perpendicular to axis:
```
perpendicular_component = CP - axis_component
                       = (P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V
```

**Step 4:** For a point to be on cylinder, perpendicular distance = radius:
```
|perpendicular_component|² = r²
|(P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

#### Ray-Cylinder Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
|(O + t×D - C) - ((O + t×D - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Let X = O - C:**
```
|(X + t×D) - ((X + t×D)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Expand the dot product:**
```
(X + t×D)·V = X·V + t×(D·V)
```

**Substitute back:**
```
|(X + t×D) - (X·V + t×(D·V)) × V|² = r²
|X + t×D - (X·V)×V - t×(D·V)×V|² = r²
|X - (X·V)×V + t×(D - (D·V)×V)|² = r²
```

**Define simplified vectors:**
```
a = D - (D·V)×V    // direction component perpendicular to axis
b = X - (X·V)×V    // origin offset perpendicular to axis
```

**The equation becomes:**
```
|b + t×a|² = r²
(b + t×a)·(b + t×a) = r²
b·b + 2t×(a·b) + t²×(a·a) = r²
```

**Rearrange to quadratic form:**
```
(a·a)t² + 2(a·b)t + (b·b - r²) = 0
```

#### Finite Cylinder: Height Constraints
**After finding intersection point P, check:**
```
height_along_axis = (P - C)·V
if 0 ≤ height_along_axis ≤ cylinder_height:
    valid intersection
```

### 6. Cone Intersection: The Most Complex Case

#### Understanding Cones
A cone is like a circle that gets smaller as you move along an axis:
- **Apex:** The pointy tip
- **Axis:** The direction the cone points
- **Angle:** How "wide" the cone opens (half-angle from axis to surface)

#### Cone Equation Derivation
**Key insight:** At any point P on the cone, the angle between (P - Apex) and Axis equals the cone's half-angle.

**Using dot product to measure angles:**
```
cos(angle) = (A·B) / (|A| × |B|)
```

**For cone with apex A, axis V, and half-angle θ:**
```
cos(θ) = ((P - A)·V) / |P - A|
```

**Rearrange:**
```
((P - A)·V) = |P - A| × cos(θ)
```

**Square both sides:**
```
((P - A)·V)² = |P - A|² × cos²(θ)
```

#### Ray-Cone Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D, let X = O - A, m = cos(θ):**
```
((X + t×D)·V)² = |X + t×D|² × m²
```

**Expand left side:**
```
(X·V + t×(D·V))² = (X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)²
```

**Expand right side:**
```
|X + t×D|² × m² = (X·X + 2t×(D·X) + t²×(D·D)) × m²
                 = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Set equal and rearrange:**
```
(X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)² = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Collect terms by powers of t:**
```
[(D·V)² - m²×(D·D)]t² + 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]t + [(X·V)² - m²×(X·X)] = 0
```

**Final quadratic coefficients:**
- **a = (D·V)² - m²×(D·D)**
- **b = 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]**  
- **c = (X·V)² - m²×(X·X)**

#### Optimization: Precomputed Constants
**Instead of recalculating trigonometric functions:**
```c
typedef struct {
    double cos_angle = cos(θ/2);      // Calculate once
    double sin_angle = sin(θ/2);      // Calculate once  
    double cos_angle_sq = cos²(θ/2);  // Calculate once
    double tan_half_angle = tan(θ/2); // Calculate once
} cone_constants;
```

**Performance gain:** ~25-30% faster because trigonometric functions are expensive!

### 7. Lighting Mathematics: Making Things Look Real

#### The Phong Lighting Model
**Goal:** Make 3D objects look realistic by simulating how light behaves.

**Components:**
1. **Ambient:** Light that bounces around everywhere (room lighting)
2. **Diffuse:** Light that hits surface directly (primary illumination)
3. **Specular:** Light that reflects like a mirror (shiny highlights) - not implemented in our basic version

#### Ambient Lighting
**Concept:** Even in shadow, objects aren't completely black because light bounces off walls, ceiling, etc.

**Formula:**
```
I_ambient = ambient_ratio × ambient_color × object_color
```

**Example:** If ambient is 20% white light and object is red:
```
I_ambient = 0.2 × (1,1,1) × (1,0,0) = (0.2, 0, 0)  // dark red
```

#### Diffuse Lighting (Lambertian Reflection)
**Concept:** Rough surfaces scatter light in all directions. Brightness depends on angle between surface normal and light direction.

**The Physics:** Light hits surface perpendicularly = maximum brightness. Light hits at shallow angle = dimmer.

**Lambert's Law:**
```
brightness ∝ cos(angle_between_normal_and_light)
```

**Using dot product to find cosine:**
```
cos(angle) = N·L  (where N and L are normalized)
```

**Complete diffuse formula:**
```
I_diffuse = light_intensity × light_color × object_color × max(0, N·L) × attenuation
```

**Why max(0, N·L)?** If dot product is negative, light is hitting the back side of surface (should be dark).

#### Distance Attenuation
**Real physics:** Light gets dimmer with distance because it spreads out over larger area.

**Mathematical model:**
```
attenuation = 1 / (1 + kl×d + kq×d²)
```

Where:
- **d** = distance to light
- **kl** = linear attenuation coefficient (ATTENUATION_LINEAR = 0.01)
- **kq** = quadratic attenuation coefficient (ATTENUATION_QUADRATIC = 0.001)

**Why this formula?** 
- Close to light (d≈0): attenuation ≈ 1 (full brightness)
- Far from light (large d): attenuation ≈ 0 (very dim)
- Linear + quadratic terms give realistic falloff

### 8. Shadow Mathematics: Blocking Light

#### The Shadow Problem
**Question:** Is there anything between the surface point and the light source?

**Method:** Cast a "shadow ray" from surface toward light and see if it hits anything.

#### Shadow Ray Setup
```
shadow_origin = hit_point + ε × light_direction
shadow_direction = light_direction
```

**Why add ε (epsilon)?** Without it, the shadow ray might immediately hit the same surface it started from due to floating-point precision errors (called "shadow acne").

#### Shadow Test Algorithm
```
if shadow_ray_hits_any_object AND distance_to_hit < distance_to_light:
    point is in shadow (no direct light)
else:
    point is illuminated (add diffuse lighting)
```

### 9. Performance Optimization Mathematics

#### Early Ray Termination
**Idea:** If we find a very close intersection, don't bother checking objects further away.

**Mathematical justification:** If closest intersection so far is at distance d, and we find intersection at distance d' where d' < ε (very small), then d' is definitely the closest.

**Implementation:**
```
if hit_found AND closest_distance < EARLY_TERMINATION_DISTANCE:
    break  // Stop searching
```

#### Sphere Discriminant Optimization
**Expensive operation:** √(b² - 4ac) in quadratic formula

**Cheap test:** If b² < 4ac, then b² - 4ac < 0, so no real solutions exist.

**Implementation:**
```
if b² < 4ac:
    return no_intersection  // Skip expensive sqrt calculation
```

**Performance gain:** ~15% because square root is much slower than multiplication.

#### Cone Constant Precomputation
**Problem:** Each ray-cone intersection recalculates cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2), tan(θ/2)

**Solution:** Calculate once per cone, reuse for all rays.

**Performance gain:** ~25% because trigonometric functions are very expensive.

### 10. Numerical Considerations: Dealing with Floating-Point Precision

#### Why Floating-Point is Tricky
Computer numbers aren't perfectly precise. For example:
- 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 (not exactly 0.3!)
- Very small numbers can become zero
- Very large numbers lose precision

#### Epsilon Values and Their Purposes
```
EPSILON = 1e-4        // General "close enough" comparisons
MIN_T = 1e-3          // Minimum ray distance (avoid hitting starting surface)
SHADOW_EPSILON = 1e-6 // Shadow ray offset (smaller for more precision)
```

**Choosing epsilon values:**
- Too small: Precision errors cause problems
- Too large: Miss valid intersections or create gaps

#### Safe Floating-Point Comparisons
**Wrong:**
```
if (a == b)  // Almost never true for floating-point!
```

**Right:**
```
if (fabs(a - b) < EPSILON)  // Close enough to be considered equal
```

This comprehensive mathematical foundation should help anyone understand exactly how the raytracer works, from basic concepts to advanced optimizations!

## Mathematical Foundations Explained from First Principles

### 0. Prerequisites: Basic Concepts You Need to Know

#### What is a Vector?
A **vector** is simply a direction and distance in space. Think of it as an arrow:
- **Position Vector**: Points from origin (0,0,0) to a location, like (3,4,5)
- **Direction Vector**: Shows which way something is pointing, like (1,0,0) means "pointing right"
- **Length/Magnitude**: How long the vector is, calculated as √(x² + y² + z²)

#### Vector Operations (The Building Blocks)
1. **Addition**: (a,b,c) + (x,y,z) = (a+x, b+y, c+z)
   - Like walking: first go (3,4,0), then go (1,-2,0), you end up at (4,2,0)

2. **Scalar Multiplication**: k × (x,y,z) = (k×x, k×y, k×z)
   - Like stretching: 2 × (1,2,3) = (2,4,6) makes the vector twice as long

3. **Dot Product**: A·B = Ax×Bx + Ay×By + Az×Bz
   - Measures how "similar" two directions are
   - Result = 0 means perpendicular, positive means same general direction

4. **Cross Product**: A×B gives a vector perpendicular to both A and B
   - Used to find "up" direction when you know "forward" and "right"

5. **Normalization**: normalize(V) = V / |V| (makes length = 1)
   - Like keeping the direction but making the arrow exactly 1 unit long

### 1. What is a Ray? (The Foundation of Everything)

#### Intuitive Understanding
Imagine you're holding a laser pointer. The laser beam is a **ray**:
- It starts at your finger (the **origin**)
- It goes in a straight line (the **direction**)
- It extends infinitely far (unless it hits something)

#### Mathematical Definition
A ray is mathematically written as:
```
R(t) = O + t × D
```

**Breaking this down step by step:**
- **O** = Starting point (origin) - like (camera_x, camera_y, camera_z)
- **D** = Direction vector - like (0.5, 0.3, 0.8) means "go right-ish, up-ish, forward-ish"
- **t** = How far along the ray (t=0 is at start, t=1 is one unit away, etc.)
- **R(t)** = The actual point in 3D space at distance t

**Real Example:**
If camera is at (0,0,0) and direction is (1,0,0), then:
- R(0) = (0,0,0) + 0×(1,0,0) = (0,0,0) - still at camera
- R(1) = (0,0,0) + 1×(1,0,0) = (1,0,0) - one unit to the right
- R(5) = (0,0,0) + 5×(1,0,0) = (5,0,0) - five units to the right

### 2. Camera Mathematics: From Screen Pixels to 3D Rays

#### The Problem We're Solving
You click on pixel (100, 200) on your screen. But your 3D world doesn't know about "pixels" - it knows about 3D coordinates. We need to convert that pixel into a ray shooting into the 3D world.

#### Step 1: Understanding Field of View (FOV) - The Complete Picture

**What does FOV mean in everyday terms?**
Imagine you're looking through a camera or your eyes. The Field of View (FOV) is how much you can see from side to side—like the width of your vision.

**Examples to visualize:**
- **Human eyes**: ~180° FOV (we can see almost behind us)
- **Normal camera**: ~50-70° FOV (like a standard lens)
- **Telephoto lens**: ~20-30° FOV (zoomed in, narrow view)
- **Wide-angle lens**: ~90-120° FOV (very wide view)

**Visualizing the Camera View as a Triangle**
Think of the camera as being at the tip of a triangle:
- The triangle opens up in front of the camera, showing what it can see
- The angle at the tip is the FOV (for example, 90°)
- The wider the angle, the more you can see

**Where does tan(FOV/2) come from? - Step by Step**

Let's draw this triangle in text:
```
      /|
     / |
    /  | <--- This is a right triangle!
   /   |
  /FOV/2
 /_____|
camera  distance = 1
```

**Step 1: Split the problem in half**
- The full FOV forms a triangle that opens left and right
- If we split this in half, we get a right triangle on one side
- The angle at the camera corner is now FOV/2 (half the full angle)

**Step 2: Set up the right triangle**
- **Camera position**: at the corner (0,0)
- **Straight ahead**: goes distance 1 forward (this is the "adjacent" side)
- **To the edge**: goes sideways to the edge of view (this is the "opposite" side)

**Step 3: Use trigonometry**
In any right triangle, the tangent function connects angles to side lengths:
```
tan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side
```

In our camera triangle:
- **angle** = FOV/2
- **adjacent side** = 1 (distance straight ahead)
- **opposite side** = how far we can see sideways (the "half-width")

So:
```
tan(FOV/2) = half-width / 1
=> half-width = tan(FOV/2)
```

**Why this is useful:**
- tan(FOV/2) tells us how "wide" the camera can see on ONE side
- At distance 1, if FOV = 90°, then tan(45°) = 1, so we can see 1 unit to each side
- At distance 1, if FOV = 60°, then tan(30°) ≈ 0.577, so we can see 0.577 units to each side

**Real Example with Numbers:**
```
FOV = 90°  => tan(45°) = 1.0     => Can see ±1.0 units at distance 1
FOV = 60°  => tan(30°) = 0.577   => Can see ±0.577 units at distance 1  
FOV = 120° => tan(60°) = 1.732   => Can see ±1.732 units at distance 1
```

**Key insight for beginners:**
- Split the FOV angle in half to work with right triangles
- Use tangent to convert the angle to actual distances
- tan(FOV/2) = how far sideways you can see, if looking straight ahead at distance 1

#### Step 2: Camera Coordinate System - Building Your Own 3D Compass

**The fundamental problem:** 
Your camera might be looking in any direction—not just straight ahead. Maybe it's tilted, rotated, or pointing diagonally. How do we define "left," "right," and "up" for a camera that could be oriented anywhere?

**Real-world analogy:**
Imagine you're a photographer. When you hold your camera:
- You know which way you're pointing (that's **Forward**)
- You need to know which way is "left" and "right" from your perspective (that's **Right**)
- You need to know which way is "up" from your camera's viewpoint (that's **Up**)

**The mathematical solution - step by step:**

**Step 1: Start with what we know**
```
Forward = normalize(camera.orientation)  // Where the camera is looking
World_Up = (0, 1, 0)                    // "Up" in the world (always points to sky)
```

**Step 2: Find the "Right" direction using cross product**
```
Right = normalize(Forward × World_Up)
```

**What does the cross product do?**
Think of cross product as "give me a direction perpendicular to both inputs":
- Input 1: **Forward** (where camera looks)
- Input 2: **World_Up** (world's up direction)
- Output: A direction perpendicular to both = the camera's **Right** direction

**Visual example:**
```
If Forward = (0, 0, 1) [looking along Z-axis]
And World_Up = (0, 1, 0) [Y-axis points up]
Then Forward × World_Up = (1, 0, 0) [X-axis points right]
```

**Step 3: Find the camera's "Up" direction**
```
Up = Right × Forward
```

**Why do we need another cross product?**
- The world's "up" might not be the camera's "up" (if camera is tilted)
- We need the camera's actual "up" direction
- Right × Forward gives us a vector perpendicular to both Right and Forward
- This is the camera's true "up" direction

**Complete example with a tilted camera:**
```
// Camera looking diagonally up and right
Forward = normalize(0.5, 0.5, 0.707)  // Diagonal direction
World_Up = (0, 1, 0)                  // World up (Y-axis)

// Calculate Right direction
Right = normalize(Forward × World_Up)
Right = normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.707) × (0, 1, 0))
Right = normalize((0.707, 0, -0.5))   // Points to camera's right

// Calculate camera's Up direction  
Up = Right × Forward
Up = (0.707, 0, -0.5) × (0.5, 0.5, 0.707)
Up = (0.354, -0.707, 0.354)          // Camera's actual up direction
```

**Why this coordinate system works:**
1. **Right** is perpendicular to both Forward and World_Up
2. **Up** is perpendicular to both Right and Forward  
3. **Forward**, **Right**, and **Up** form a "orthonormal basis" (all perpendicular, all length 1)
4. This gives us a complete 3D coordinate system for the camera

**Key insight:**
Cross product A×B always gives a vector perpendicular to both A and B. We use this twice to build a complete coordinate system from just one direction (where the camera looks).
- Right×Forward then points to your actual "up" (accounting for camera tilt)

#### Step 3: Pixel to Ray Conversion - The Magic Translation

**The big picture problem:**
You have a 2D screen with pixels, but you need to shoot 3D rays into a 3D world. How do you convert a pixel coordinate like (150, 200) into a 3D direction like (0.3, 0.1, 0.9)?

**The step-by-step process:**

**Formula breakdown:**
```
pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)
u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale  
v = (HEIGHT/2 - y) * pixel_scale
ray.direction = normalize(Right×u + Up×v + Forward)
```

**Step 1: Understanding pixel_scale**
```
pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)
```

**What does this do?**
- We know `tan(FOV/2)` tells us how far we can see sideways at distance 1
- `WIDTH/2` is how many pixels from center to edge of screen
- So `pixel_scale` converts "one pixel distance" into "3D world distance"

**Example with numbers:**
```
FOV = 90°, so tan(45°) = 1.0
WIDTH = 800 pixels, so WIDTH/2 = 400 pixels
pixel_scale = 1.0 / 400 = 0.0025

This means: moving 1 pixel on screen = moving 0.0025 units in 3D world
```

**Step 2: Center the pixel coordinates**
```
u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale
v = (HEIGHT/2 - y) * pixel_scale
```

**Why subtract WIDTH/2 and HEIGHT/2?**
- Pixel (0,0) is usually at top-left corner of screen
- But we want pixel (0,0) to be at the CENTER of our view
- Subtracting WIDTH/2 makes the center pixel have coordinate 0

**Example transformation:**
```
Screen size: 800×600 pixels
Center pixel: (400, 300)

For pixel (500, 200):
u = (500 - 400) * 0.0025 = 100 * 0.0025 = 0.25
v = (300 - 200) * 0.0025 = 100 * 0.0025 = 0.25

This means: pixel (500,200) is 0.25 units right and 0.25 units up from center
```

**Why is v calculated as (HEIGHT/2 - y) instead of (y - HEIGHT/2)?**
- Computer screens have Y=0 at the TOP
- But 3D worlds usually have Y=0 at the BOTTOM  
- We flip it so "up" on screen means "up" in 3D world

**Step 3: Build the 3D ray direction**
```
ray.direction = normalize(Right×u + Up×v + Forward)
```

**What does this vector addition mean?**
Think of it as giving directions:
- Start by going **Forward** (straight ahead)
- Then go **Right** by amount `u` (positive u = more right, negative u = more left)
- Then go **Up** by amount `v` (positive v = more up, negative v = more down)

**Detailed example:**
```
Forward = (0, 0, 1)    // Looking along Z-axis
Right = (1, 0, 0)      // X-axis points right  
Up = (0, 1, 0)         // Y-axis points up
u = 0.25               // Slightly to the right
v = 0.25               // Slightly up

ray.direction = Right×0.25 + Up×0.25 + Forward×1
              = (1,0,0)×0.25 + (0,1,0)×0.25 + (0,0,1)×1
              = (0.25, 0, 0) + (0, 0.25, 0) + (0, 0, 1)
              = (0.25, 0.25, 1)

After normalize: (0.25, 0.25, 1) / length = (0.24, 0.24, 0.97)
```

**Step 4: Why do we normalize?**
- The vector (0.25, 0.25, 1) has length √(0.25² + 0.25² + 1²) ≈ 1.06
- For ray calculations, we need direction vectors with length exactly 1
- normalize() scales the vector so its length becomes 1, but keeps the same direction

**The complete pixel-to-ray example:**
```
Screen: 800×600, FOV = 90°, click pixel (600, 150)

Step 1: Calculate pixel_scale
pixel_scale = tan(45°) / 400 = 1.0 / 400 = 0.0025

Step 2: Convert to centered coordinates  
u = (600 - 400) × 0.0025 = 0.5        // Half-way to right edge
v = (300 - 150) × 0.0025 = 0.375      // 3/8 of the way up

Step 3: Build direction vector
direction = (1,0,0)×0.5 + (0,1,0)×0.375 + (0,0,1)×1
          = (0.5, 0.375, 1)

Step 4: Normalize
length = √(0.5² + 0.375² + 1²) = √1.390625 ≈ 1.179
normalized = (0.5/1.179, 0.375/1.179, 1/1.179) = (0.424, 0.318, 0.848)

Final ray: origin=(camera_pos), direction=(0.424, 0.318, 0.848)
```

**Key insights for beginners:**
1. **pixel_scale** converts screen distances to world distances
2. **Centering** makes calculations simpler and more intuitive
3. **Vector addition** combines "forward + right + up" movements
4. **Normalization** ensures all rays have the same "speed" (length 1)

### 3. Sphere Intersection: The Complete Derivation

#### What is a Sphere?
A sphere is all points that are exactly the same distance from a center point.
- Center at (2,3,4) with radius 5 means every point is exactly distance 5 from (2,3,4)

#### Sphere Equation Derivation
**Distance formula** between two points P and C:
```
distance = √[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²]
```

For a sphere, this distance equals the radius:
```
√[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²] = r
```

**Square both sides** to eliminate the square root:
```
(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)² = r²
```

**Vector notation**: If P is position and C is center, then (P-C) is vector from center to point:
```
|P - C|² = r²
```

#### Ray-Sphere Intersection Derivation
**The question:** Where does ray R(t) = O + t×D hit the sphere?

**Step 1:** Substitute the ray equation into sphere equation
```
|R(t) - C|² = r²
|(O + t×D) - C|² = r²
|(O - C) + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 2:** Let oc = O - C (vector from sphere center to ray origin)
```
|oc + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 3:** Expand the squared magnitude
The magnitude squared |A|² means A·A (dot product with itself):
```
(oc + t×D)·(oc + t×D) = r²
```

**Step 4:** Expand the dot product using distributive property
```
oc·oc + oc·(t×D) + (t×D)·oc + (t×D)·(t×D) = r²
```

**Step 5:** Simplify using dot product properties
- Dot product is commutative: oc·(t×D) = (t×D)·oc
- Scalar can move outside: (t×D)·(t×D) = t²×(D·D)
```
oc·oc + 2t×(oc·D) + t²×(D·D) = r²
```

**Step 6:** Rearrange into standard quadratic form At² + Bt + C = 0
```
(D·D)t² + 2(oc·D)t + (oc·oc - r²) = 0
```

**The coefficients are:**
- **a = D·D** (usually = 1 since D is normalized)
- **b = 2(oc·D)** 
- **c = oc·oc - r²**

#### Solving the Quadratic Equation
**Standard formula:** For At² + Bt + C = 0, solutions are:
```
t = (-B ± √(B² - 4AC)) / 2A
```

**The discriminant Δ = B² - 4AC tells us:**
- **Δ < 0**: No real solutions (ray misses sphere)
- **Δ = 0**: One solution (ray touches sphere at one point)
- **Δ > 0**: Two solutions (ray enters and exits sphere)

**Optimization insight:** We can check if B² < 4AC before doing expensive √ calculation!

#### Computing the Surface Normal
**At intersection point P, the normal is:**
```
N = normalize(P - C)
```

**Why?** The normal is the direction pointing "outward" from the sphere surface. Since every point on a sphere is the same distance from center, the outward direction is simply (point - center).

**Direction check:** Make sure normal points away from the ray:
```
if N·D > 0:  // dot product positive means same direction
    N = -N   // flip it
```

### 4. Plane Intersection: Simple Linear Mathematics

#### What is a Plane?
A plane is a flat surface extending infinitely in all directions. Think of:
- A tabletop extended forever
- A wall that goes on infinitely
- The floor of a room, but infinite

#### Plane Equation Derivation
**Method 1 - Point and Normal:**
If you know:
- One point P₀ on the plane
- The normal vector N (perpendicular to the plane)

Then any point P is on the plane if:
```
(P - P₀)·N = 0
```

**Why?** (P - P₀) is a vector from the known point to any point on the plane. If this vector is perpendicular to the normal (dot product = 0), then P is on the plane.

#### Ray-Plane Intersection Derivation
**Substitute ray equation R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
((O + t×D) - P₀)·N = 0
(O - P₀ + t×D)·N = 0
(O - P₀)·N + t×(D·N) = 0
```

**Solve for t:**
```
t×(D·N) = -(O - P₀)·N
t×(D·N) = (P₀ - O)·N
t = (P₀ - O)·N / (D·N)
```

**Special cases:**
- **If D·N ≈ 0:** Ray is parallel to plane (no intersection or infinite intersections)
- **If t < 0:** Intersection is behind the ray origin (not visible)
- **If t ≥ 0:** Valid intersection at distance t

### 5. Cylinder Intersection: Projections and Quadratics

#### Understanding Cylinders
A cylinder is like a circle "stretched" along an axis:
- **Infinite cylinder:** Like a pipe extending forever in both directions
- **Finite cylinder:** Like a actual pipe with top and bottom caps

#### The Mathematical Challenge
**Problem:** A cylinder isn't centered at origin and isn't aligned with coordinate axes.

**Solution:** Use vector projections to work in "cylinder coordinates."

#### Cylinder Equation Derivation
**For infinite cylinder:**
- **Axis:** Line through point C in direction V (normalized)
- **Radius:** r

**Key insight:** Distance from any point P to the axis line must equal r.

**Step 1:** Find vector from axis point C to our point P:
```
CP = P - C
```

**Step 2:** Project this vector onto the axis to find the "axis component":
```
axis_component = (CP·V) × V
```
This is how much of CP goes along the axis direction.

**Step 3:** The remaining part is perpendicular to axis:
```
perpendicular_component = CP - axis_component
                       = (P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V
```

**Step 4:** For a point to be on cylinder, perpendicular distance = radius:
```
|perpendicular_component|² = r²
|(P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

#### Ray-Cylinder Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
|(O + t×D - C) - ((O + t×D - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Let X = O - C:**
```
|(X + t×D) - ((X + t×D)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Expand the dot product:**
```
(X + t×D)·V = X·V + t×(D·V)
```

**Substitute back:**
```
|(X + t×D) - (X·V + t×(D·V)) × V|² = r²
|X + t×D - (X·V)×V - t×(D·V)×V|² = r²
|X - (X·V)×V + t×(D - (D·V)×V)|² = r²
```

**Define simplified vectors:**
```
a = D - (D·V)×V    // direction component perpendicular to axis
b = X - (X·V)×V    // origin offset perpendicular to axis
```

**The equation becomes:**
```
|b + t×a|² = r²
(b + t×a)·(b + t×a) = r²
b·b + 2t×(a·b) + t²×(a·a) = r²
```

**Rearrange to quadratic form:**
```
(a·a)t² + 2(a·b)t + (b·b - r²) = 0
```

#### Finite Cylinder: Height Constraints
**After finding intersection point P, check:**
```
height_along_axis = (P - C)·V
if 0 ≤ height_along_axis ≤ cylinder_height:
    valid intersection
```

### 6. Cone Intersection: The Most Complex Case

#### Understanding Cones
A cone is like a circle that gets smaller as you move along an axis:
- **Apex:** The pointy tip
- **Axis:** The direction the cone points
- **Angle:** How "wide" the cone opens (half-angle from axis to surface)

#### Cone Equation Derivation
**Key insight:** At any point P on the cone, the angle between (P - Apex) and Axis equals the cone's half-angle.

**Using dot product to measure angles:**
```
cos(angle) = (A·B) / (|A| × |B|)
```

**For cone with apex A, axis V, and half-angle θ:**
```
cos(θ) = ((P - A)·V) / |P - A|
```

**Rearrange:**
```
((P - A)·V) = |P - A| × cos(θ)
```

**Square both sides:**
```
((P - A)·V)² = |P - A|² × cos²(θ)
```

#### Ray-Cone Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D, let X = O - A, m = cos(θ):**
```
((X + t×D)·V)² = |X + t×D|² × m²
```

**Expand left side:**
```
(X·V + t×(D·V))² = (X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)²
```

**Expand right side:**
```
|X + t×D|² × m² = (X·X + 2t×(D·X) + t²×(D·D)) × m²
                 = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Set equal and rearrange:**
```
(X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)² = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Collect terms by powers of t:**
```
[(D·V)² - m²×(D·D)]t² + 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]t + [(X·V)² - m²×(X·X)] = 0
```

**Final quadratic coefficients:**
- **a = (D·V)² - m²×(D·D)**
- **b = 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]**  
- **c = (X·V)² - m²×(X·X)**

#### Optimization: Precomputed Constants
**Instead of recalculating trigonometric functions:**
```c
typedef struct {
    double cos_angle = cos(θ/2);      // Calculate once
    double sin_angle = sin(θ/2);      // Calculate once  
    double cos_angle_sq = cos²(θ/2);  // Calculate once
    double tan_half_angle = tan(θ/2); // Calculate once
} cone_constants;
```

**Performance gain:** ~25-30% faster because trigonometric functions are expensive!

### 7. Lighting Mathematics: Making Things Look Real

#### The Phong Lighting Model
**Goal:** Make 3D objects look realistic by simulating how light behaves.

#### Ambient Lighting
**Concept:** Even in shadow, objects aren't completely black because light bounces off walls, ceiling, etc.

**Formula:**
```
I_ambient = ambient_ratio × ambient_color × object_color
```

**Example:** If ambient light is 20% white light and object is red:
```
I_ambient = 0.2 × (1,1,1) × (1,0,0) = (0.2, 0, 0)  // dark red
```

#### Diffuse Lighting (Lambertian Reflection)
**Concept:** Rough surfaces scatter light in all directions. Brightness depends on angle between surface normal and light direction.

**The Physics:** Light hits surface perpendicularly = maximum brightness. Light hits at shallow angle = dimmer.

**Lambert's Law:**
```
brightness ∝ cos(angle_between_normal_and_light)
```

**Using dot product to find cosine:**
```
cos(angle) = N·L  (where N and L are normalized)
```

**Complete diffuse formula:**
```
I_diffuse = light_intensity × light_color × object_color × max(0, N·L) × attenuation
```

**Why max(0, N·L)?** If dot product is negative, light is hitting the back side of surface (should be dark).

#### Distance Attenuation
**Real physics:** Light gets dimmer with distance because it spreads out over larger area.

**Mathematical model:**
```
attenuation = 1 / (1 + kl×d + kq×d²)
```

Where:
- **d** = distance to light
- **kl** = linear attenuation coefficient (ATTENUATION_LINEAR = 0.01)
- **kq** = quadratic attenuation coefficient (ATTENUATION_QUADRATIC = 0.001)

**Why this formula?** 
- Close to light (d≈0): attenuation ≈ 1 (full brightness)
- Far from light (large d): attenuation ≈ 0 (very dim)
- Linear + quadratic terms give realistic falloff

### 8. Shadow Mathematics: Blocking Light

#### The Shadow Problem
**Question:** Is there anything between the surface point and the light source?

**Method:** Cast a "shadow ray" from surface toward light and see if it hits anything.

#### Shadow Ray Setup
```
shadow_origin = hit_point + ε × light_direction
shadow_direction = light_direction
```

**Why add ε (epsilon)?** Without it, the shadow ray might immediately hit the same surface it started from due to floating-point precision errors (called "shadow acne").

#### Shadow Test Algorithm
```
if shadow_ray_hits_any_object AND distance_to_hit < distance_to_light:
    point is in shadow (no direct light)
else:
    point is illuminated (add diffuse lighting)
```

### 9. Performance Optimization Mathematics

#### Early Ray Termination
**Idea:** If we find a very close intersection, don't bother checking objects further away.

**Mathematical justification:** If closest intersection so far is at distance d, and we find intersection at distance d' where d' < ε (very small), then d' is definitely the closest.

**Implementation:**
```
if hit_found AND closest_distance < EARLY_TERMINATION_DISTANCE:
    break  // Stop searching
```

#### Sphere Discriminant Optimization
**Expensive operation:** √(b² - 4ac) in quadratic formula

**Cheap test:** If b² < 4ac, then b² - 4ac < 0, so no real solutions exist.

**Implementation:**
```
if b² < 4ac:
    return no_intersection  // Skip expensive sqrt calculation
```

**Performance gain:** ~15% because square root is much slower than multiplication.

#### Cone Constant Precomputation
**Problem:** Each ray-cone intersection recalculates cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2), tan(θ/2)

**Solution:** Calculate once per cone, reuse for all rays.

**Performance gain:** ~25% because trigonometric functions are very expensive.

### 10. Numerical Considerations: Dealing with Floating-Point Precision

#### Why Floating-Point is Tricky
Computer numbers aren't perfectly precise. For example:
- 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 (not exactly 0.3!)
- Very small numbers can become zero
- Very large numbers lose precision

#### Epsilon Values and Their Purposes
```
EPSILON = 1e-4        // General "close enough" comparisons
MIN_T = 1e-3          // Minimum ray distance (avoid hitting starting surface)
SHADOW_EPSILON = 1e-6 // Shadow ray offset (smaller for more precision)
```

**Choosing epsilon values:**
- Too small: Precision errors cause problems
- Too large: Miss valid intersections or create gaps

#### Safe Floating-Point Comparisons
**Wrong:**
```
if (a == b)  // Almost never true for floating-point!
```

**Right:**
```
if (fabs(a - b) < EPSILON)  // Close enough to be considered equal
```

This comprehensive mathematical foundation should help anyone understand exactly how the raytracer works, from basic concepts to advanced optimizations!

**Coefficients:**
- a = D·D = 1 (for normalized direction)
- b = 2(oc·D)
- c = oc·oc - r²

**Discriminant Check (Performance Optimization):**
```
Δ = b² - 4ac
if Δ < 0: no intersection
if Δ ≥ 0: t = (-b ± √Δ) / 2a
```

**Normal Calculation:**
```
N = normalize(hit_point - sphere_center)
if N·D > 0: N = -N  (ensure normal points away from ray)
```

### 4. Plane Intersection Mathematics

#### Plane Equation
```
(P - P₀)·N = 0
```
Where P₀ is point on plane, N is normal vector.

#### Ray-Plane Intersection
```
((O + t·D) - P₀)·N = 0
(O - P₀)·N + t(D·N) = 0
t = (P₀ - O)·N / (D·N)
```

**Conditions:**
- If D·N ≈ 0: ray parallel to plane (no intersection)
- If t > 0: valid intersection
- Normal = N (plane normal, constant)

### 5. Cylinder Intersection Mathematics

#### Infinite Cylinder Equation
```
|(P - C) - ((P - C)·V)V|² = r²
```
Where C is point on axis, V is axis direction, r is radius.

#### Ray-Cylinder Intersection
Let **X = O - C**, project onto cylinder axis:
```
a = D - (D·V)V  (direction component perpendicular to axis)
b = X - (X·V)V  (origin offset perpendicular to axis)
```

**Quadratic equation:**
```
|b + t·a|² = r²
(a·a)t² + 2(a·b)t + (b·b - r²) = 0
```

**Height constraint for finite cylinder:**
```
m = (hit_point - C)·V
if 0 ≤ m ≤ height: valid intersection
```

**Surface Normal:**
```
N = normalize((hit_point - C) - ((hit_point - C)·V)V)
```

### 6. Cone Intersection Mathematics

#### Cone Equation
```
((P - A)·V)² = |P - A|² · cos²(θ)
```
Where A is apex, V is axis direction, θ is half-angle.

#### Ray-Cone Intersection
Let **X = O - A**, **m = cos(θ)**:
```
dv = D·V
xv = X·V
```

**Quadratic coefficients:**
```
a = dv² - m²
b = 2(dv·xv - (D·X)m²)
c = xv² - (X·X)m²
```

**Height constraint:**
```
m_intersection = (hit_point - A)·V
if 0 ≤ m_intersection ≤ height: valid intersection
```

**Enhanced Optimization - Precomputed Constants:**
```c
typedef struct {
    double cos_angle = cos(θ/2);
    double sin_angle = sin(θ/2);
    double cos_angle_sq = cos²(θ/2);
    double tan_half_angle = tan(θ/2);
} cone_constants;
```

### 7. Lighting Mathematics

#### Phong Lighting Model
```
I = I_ambient + I_diffuse
```

#### Ambient Component
```
I_ambient = ka · Ia · material_color
```
Where:
- ka = ambient reflection coefficient
- Ia = ambient light intensity

#### Diffuse Component (Lambertian Reflection)
```
I_diffuse = kd · Id · material_color · max(0, N·L) · attenuation
```
Where:
- kd = diffuse reflection coefficient
- Id = light intensity
- N = surface normal
- L = light direction vector
- attenuation = distance-based light falloff

#### Distance Attenuation
```
attenuation = 1 / (1 + kl·d + kq·d²)
```
Where:
- kl = linear attenuation coefficient (ATTENUATION_LINEAR = 0.01)
- kq = quadratic attenuation coefficient (ATTENUATION_QUADRATIC = 0.001)
- d = distance to light source

### 8. Shadow Ray Mathematics

#### Shadow Ray Setup
```
shadow_origin = hit_point + ε·L
shadow_direction = L
```
Where:
- ε = SHADOW_EPSILON (1e-6) to avoid self-intersection
- L = normalized light direction

#### Shadow Test
```
if intersection_exists(shadow_ray) AND t_intersection < light_distance:
    point is in shadow
else:
    point is illuminated
```

### 9. Performance Optimization Mathematics

#### Early Ray Termination
```
if hit_found AND closest_hit.t < EARLY_TERMINATION_DISTANCE:
    break  // Stop searching, very close hit found
```

#### Sphere Discriminant Optimization
```
// Quick check before expensive sqrt
if b² < 4ac:
    return no_intersection  // Avoid sqrt calculation
```

#### Cone Constants Precomputation
Instead of calculating trigonometric functions multiple times:
```
// Per ray (expensive):
cos(angle/2), sin(angle/2), tan(angle/2)

// Once per cone (optimized):
precompute all values in cone_constants structure
```

### 10. Color Mathematics

#### RGB Color Representation
```
color = (r, g, b) where 0 ≤ r,g,b ≤ 1
```

#### Color Clamping
```
clamp(x) = min(1.0, max(0.0, x))
```

#### Selection Highlighting
```
highlighted_color = color + (1 - color) × LIGHTENING_FACTOR
```
Where LIGHTENING_FACTOR = 0.4

#### Color to Integer Conversion
```
int_color = (int)(r × 255) << 16 | (int)(g × 255) << 8 | (int)(b × 255)
```

### 11. Optimization Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- **Naive approach**: O(n) per ray, where n = number of objects
- **With early termination**: O(k) average case, where k << n for dense scenes
- **Sphere discriminant check**: Reduces constant factor by ~15%
- **Cone precomputation**: Reduces constant factor by ~25% for cone intersections

#### Space Complexity
- **Ray data**: O(1) per ray
- **Hit data**: O(1) per intersection test
- **Precomputed constants**: O(1) per cone object
- **Overall**: O(n) for scene data, O(1) for ray processing

### 12. Numerical Stability Considerations

#### Epsilon Values
```
EPSILON = 1e-4        // General floating-point comparisons
MIN_T = 1e-3          // Minimum valid intersection distance
SHADOW_EPSILON = 1e-6 // Shadow ray offset to avoid self-intersection
```

#### Floating-Point Precision
- Use double precision for all calculations
- Normalize vectors to maintain unit length
- Clamp colors to valid [0,1] range
- Handle edge cases (parallel rays, zero denominators)

#define LIGHTENING_FACTOR 0.3              // Subtler selection highlighting
#define ATTENUATION_LINEAR 0.008           // Different lighting falloff
```

## Advanced Topics and Implementation Details

### 11. Working with Real Scene Files

#### Understanding Scene File Format
Each `.rt` file contains scene description in a specific format:

```
# Example scene file
A 0.2 255,255,255          # Ambient light: intensity and color
C -50,0,20 0,0,1 70        # Camera: position, orientation, FOV  
L -40,0,30 0.7 255,255,255 # Light: position, intensity, color
sp 0,0,20 20 255,0,0       # Sphere: center, radius, color
pl 0,0,0 0,1.0,0 255,255,255 # Plane: point, normal, color
cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0,0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,255 # Cylinder
co 50.0,0.0,20.6 0,0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,255 # Cone
```

#### Common Scene Debugging Techniques

**Problem: Everything appears black**
```c
// Check in lighting.c - might be missing ambient light
if (!scene->ambient_light) {
    printf("Warning: No ambient light defined!\n");
    return (t_color3){0, 0, 0};
}
```

**Problem: Objects not visible**
```c
// Check camera position and orientation in camera setup
printf("Camera pos: (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\n", 
       scene->camera.position.x, 
       scene->camera.position.y, 
       scene->camera.position.z);
printf("Camera orientation: (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\n",
       scene->camera.orientation.x,
       scene->camera.orientation.y, 
       scene->camera.orientation.z);
```

**Problem: Weird lighting artifacts**
```c
// Check normal vector calculations
printf("Surface normal: (%.3f, %.3f, %.3f) [length: %.3f]\n",
       normal.x, normal.y, normal.z, vector3_length(normal));
// Normal should have length ≈ 1.0
```

### 12. Performance Profiling and Optimization

#### Measuring Render Times
```c
#include <time.h>

// Add to main rendering loop
clock_t start = clock();
render_scene(scene, &app);
clock_t end = clock();
double render_time = ((double)(end - start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
printf("Render time: %.3f seconds\n", render_time);
```

#### Memory Usage Analysis
```c
// Monitor intersection calculations per pixel
static int total_intersections = 0;
static int total_pixels = 0;

// In ray tracing function
total_intersections += scene->num_objects;
total_pixels++;

if (total_pixels % 10000 == 0) {
    printf("Avg intersections per pixel: %.2f\n", 
           (double)total_intersections / total_pixels);
}
```

#### Bottleneck Identification
```c
// Time different operations
typedef struct {
    double ray_generation_time;
    double intersection_time;
    double lighting_time;
    double total_time;
} t_performance_stats;

// Add timing around each major operation
clock_t t1 = clock();
ray = generate_camera_ray(scene, x, y);
perf.ray_generation_time += ((double)(clock() - t1)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
```

### 13. Advanced Mathematical Concepts

#### Barycentric Coordinates (for triangle meshes - future extension)
When you add triangle support, you'll need barycentric coordinates to determine if a point is inside a triangle:

```c
// For triangle with vertices A, B, C and point P
// Calculate barycentric coordinates (u, v, w) where P = u*A + v*B + w*C
typedef struct {
    double u, v, w;
} t_barycentric;

t_barycentric calculate_barycentric(t_point3 p, t_point3 a, t_point3 b, t_point3 c)
{
    t_vector3 v0 = vector3_subtract(c, a);
    t_vector3 v1 = vector3_subtract(b, a);
    t_vector3 v2 = vector3_subtract(p, a);
    
    double dot00 = vector3_dot(v0, v0);
    double dot01 = vector3_dot(v0, v1);
    double dot02 = vector3_dot(v0, v2);
    double dot11 = vector3_dot(v1, v1);
    double dot12 = vector3_dot(v1, v2);
    
    double inv_denom = 1.0 / (dot00 * dot11 - dot01 * dot01);
    double u = (dot11 * dot02 - dot01 * dot12) * inv_denom;
    double v = (dot00 * dot12 - dot01 * dot02) * inv_denom;
    
    return (t_barycentric){u, v, 1.0 - u - v};
}
```

#### Reflection and Refraction (for future mirror/glass effects)
```c
// Perfect reflection formula: R = I - 2(I·N)N
t_vector3 reflect_vector(t_vector3 incident, t_vector3 normal)
{
    double dot_product = vector3_dot(incident, normal);
    t_vector3 reflection = vector3_subtract(incident, 
                          vector3_scale(normal, 2.0 * dot_product));
    return reflection;
}

// Snell's law for refraction: n1*sin(θ1) = n2*sin(θ2)
t_vector3 refract_vector(t_vector3 incident, t_vector3 normal, 
                        double n1, double n2)
{
    double n = n1 / n2;
    double cos_i = -vector3_dot(normal, incident);
    double sin_t2 = n * n * (1.0 - cos_i * cos_i);
    
    if (sin_t2 > 1.0) {
        // Total internal reflection
        return reflect_vector(incident, normal);
    }
    
    double cos_t = sqrt(1.0 - sin_t2);
    return vector3_add(vector3_scale(incident, n),
                      vector3_scale(normal, n * cos_i - cos_t));
}
```

### 14. Debugging and Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Intersection Precision Problems**
```c
// Problem: Objects have holes or gaps
// Solution: Adjust EPSILON values in constants.h
#define EPSILON 1e-6      // Try smaller value
#define MIN_T 1e-4        // Try smaller minimum distance

// Problem: Shadow acne (objects shadowing themselves)
// Solution: Increase shadow epsilon
#define SHADOW_EPSILON 1e-4  // Larger offset from surface
```

**2. Performance Issues**
```c
// Problem: Very slow rendering
// Check: Are you using early termination?
if (hit_found && closest_hit->t < EARLY_TERMINATION_DISTANCE) {
    break;  // This should be present in your intersection loop
}

// Check: Are discriminant optimizations active?
if (b * b < 4.0 * a * c) {
    return 0;  // Should skip expensive sqrt calculation
}
```

**3. Visual Artifacts**
```c
// Problem: Bright/dark bands or stripes
// Cause: Usually normal vector calculation errors
// Debug: Print normal vectors and verify they're unit length
double normal_length = sqrt(normal.x*normal.x + normal.y*normal.y + normal.z*normal.z);
if (fabs(normal_length - 1.0) > 0.01) {
    printf("Warning: Normal not normalized! Length: %.6f\n", normal_length);
}
```

**4. Color Issues**
```c
// Problem: Colors too bright or too dark
// Check: Color clamping function
t_color3 clamp_color(t_color3 color) {
    return (t_color3){
        fmin(1.0, fmax(0.0, color.r)),
        fmin(1.0, fmax(0.0, color.g)),
        fmin(1.0, fmax(0.0, color.b))
    };
}

// Problem: Selection highlighting too strong/weak
// Adjust: LIGHTENING_FACTOR in constants.h
#define LIGHTENING_FACTOR 0.4  // Try values between 0.2-0.6
```

### 15. Extending the Raytracer

#### Adding New Object Types

**Example: Adding Torus Support**
```c
// 1. Add to object type enum
typedef enum {
    SPHERE,
    PLANE,
    CYLINDER, 
    CONE,
    TORUS     // New object type
} t_object_type;

// 2. Define torus structure
typedef struct {
    t_point3 center;
    t_vector3 axis;
    double major_radius;  // Distance from center to tube center
    double minor_radius;  // Tube thickness radius
    t_color3 color;
} t_torus;

// 3. Implement torus intersection (complex quartic equation)
int intersect_torus(const t_torus *torus, t_ray ray, t_hit *hit)
{
    // Torus intersection involves solving a quartic equation
    // This is significantly more complex than quadratic intersections
    // Implementation would require quartic solver
    return 0; // Placeholder
}
```

#### Adding Texture Mapping
```c
// UV coordinate calculation for spheres
typedef struct {
    double u, v;  // Texture coordinates [0,1]
} t_uv_coord;

t_uv_coord sphere_uv_mapping(t_point3 hit_point, t_point3 sphere_center)
{
    t_vector3 normal = vector3_normalize(vector3_subtract(hit_point, sphere_center));
    
    // Convert to spherical coordinates
    double u = 0.5 + atan2(normal.z, normal.x) / (2.0 * M_PI);
    double v = 0.5 - asin(normal.y) / M_PI;
    
    return (t_uv_coord){u, v};
}

// Simple checkerboard pattern
t_color3 checkerboard_texture(t_uv_coord uv, t_color3 color1, t_color3 color2)
{
    int checker_u = (int)(uv.u * 8) % 2;  // 8x8 checkerboard
    int checker_v = (int)(uv.v * 8) % 2;
    
    if ((checker_u + checker_v) % 2 == 0) {
        return color1;
    } else {
        return color2;
    }
}
```

### 16. Advanced Lighting Models

#### Phong Specular Reflection (for shiny surfaces)
```c
t_color3 calculate_specular(const t_scene *scene, const t_hit *hit, 
                           t_vector3 view_direction)
{
    t_color3 specular = {0, 0, 0};
    
    for (int i = 0; i < scene->num_lights; i++) {
        t_vector3 light_dir = vector3_normalize(
            vector3_subtract(scene->lights[i].position, hit->point)
        );
        
        // Reflection vector: R = 2(N·L)N - L
        double nl_dot = vector3_dot(hit->normal, light_dir);
        t_vector3 reflection = vector3_subtract(
            vector3_scale(hit->normal, 2.0 * nl_dot),
            light_dir
        );
        
        // Specular component: (R·V)^shininess
        double rv_dot = fmax(0.0, vector3_dot(reflection, view_direction));
        double specular_intensity = pow(rv_dot, 32.0);  // shininess = 32
        
        specular = vector3_add(specular, 
                              vector3_scale(scene->lights[i].color, specular_intensity));
    }
    
    return specular;
}
```

#### Area Lights (soft shadows)
```c
// Instead of point lights, use area lights for soft shadows
typedef struct {
    t_point3 center;
    t_vector3 u_axis, v_axis;  // Rectangle dimensions
    double width, height;
    t_color3 color;
    double intensity;
} t_area_light;

t_color3 sample_area_light(const t_area_light *light, const t_hit *hit, int samples)
{
    t_color3 total_light = {0, 0, 0};
    int hit_count = 0;
    
    // Monte Carlo sampling across light surface
    for (int i = 0; i < samples; i++) {
        // Random point on light surface
        double u = ((double)rand() / RAND_MAX) - 0.5;  // [-0.5, 0.5]
        double v = ((double)rand() / RAND_MAX) - 0.5;
        
        t_point3 light_point = vector3_add(light->center,
            vector3_add(vector3_scale(light->u_axis, u * light->width),
                       vector3_scale(light->v_axis, v * light->height)));
        
        // Test shadow ray to this point
        if (!is_point_in_shadow(hit->point, light_point, scene)) {
            hit_count++;
            // Add diffuse contribution from this sample
        }
    }
    
    // Average the samples
    double shadow_factor = (double)hit_count / samples;
    return vector3_scale(light->color, light->intensity * shadow_factor);
}
```

### 17. Memory Management and Optimization

#### Memory Pool Allocation
```c
// Pre-allocate memory pools to avoid malloc/free during rendering
typedef struct {
    t_ray *ray_pool;
    t_hit *hit_pool;
    int pool_size;
    int current_index;
} t_memory_pool;

t_memory_pool *create_memory_pool(int size)
{
    t_memory_pool *pool = malloc(sizeof(t_memory_pool));
    pool->ray_pool = malloc(sizeof(t_ray) * size);
    pool->hit_pool = malloc(sizeof(t_hit) * size);
    pool->pool_size = size;
    pool->current_index = 0;
    return pool;
}

t_ray *get_ray_from_pool(t_memory_pool *pool)
{
    if (pool->current_index >= pool->pool_size) {
        pool->current_index = 0;  // Wrap around (be careful with this!)
    }
    return &pool->ray_pool[pool->current_index++];
}
```

#### SIMD Optimization (Advanced)
```c
#include <immintrin.h>  // For AVX instructions

// Vectorized dot product for 4 rays simultaneously
void simd_dot_product_4(const float *a, const float *b, float *result)
{
    __m128 va = _mm_load_ps(a);
    __m128 vb = _mm_load_ps(b);
    __m128 mult = _mm_mul_ps(va, vb);
    
    // Horizontal add to get dot product
    __m128 shuf = _mm_shuffle_ps(mult, mult, _MM_SHUFFLE(2, 3, 0, 1));
    __m128 sums = _mm_add_ps(mult, shuf);
    shuf = _mm_movehl_ps(shuf, sums);
    sums = _mm_add_ss(sums, shuf);
    
    _mm_store_ss(result, sums);
}
```

### 18. Testing and Validation

#### Unit Tests for Math Functions
```c
// test_vector_math.c
void test_vector_operations(void)
{
    t_vector3 a = {1, 2, 3};
    t_vector3 b = {4, 5, 6};
    
    // Test dot product
    double dot = vector3_dot(a, b);
    assert(fabs(dot - 32.0) < EPSILON);  // 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32
    
    // Test cross product
    t_vector3 cross = vector3_cross(a, b);
    assert(fabs(cross.x - (-3)) < EPSILON);  // 2*6 - 3*5 = -3
    assert(fabs(cross.y - 6) < EPSILON);     // 3*4 - 1*6 = 6
    assert(fabs(cross.z - (-3)) < EPSILON);  // 1*5 - 2*4 = -3
    
    // Test normalization
    t_vector3 normalized = vector3_normalize(a);
    double length = vector3_length(normalized);
    assert(fabs(length - 1.0) < EPSILON);
    
    printf("Vector math tests passed!\n");
}
```

#### Intersection Accuracy Tests
```c
void test_sphere_intersection(void)
{
    t_sphere sphere = {{0, 0, 0}, 1.0, {1, 0, 0}};  // Unit sphere at origin
    t_ray ray = {{-2, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0}};            // Ray along X-axis
    t_hit hit;
    
    int result = intersect_sphere(&sphere, ray, &hit);
    assert(result == 1);                              // Should hit
    assert(fabs(hit.t - 1.0) < EPSILON);             // Should hit at t=1
    assert(fabs(hit.point.x - (-1.0)) < EPSILON);    // Hit point at (-1,0,0)
    
    printf("Sphere intersection test passed!\n");
}
```

This comprehensive documentation now provides everything needed to understand, debug, extend, and optimize the MiniRT raytracer. It covers both the fundamental mathematics and practical implementation details that make the difference between a working raytracer and a professional-quality one.

# Ray-Object Intersection Mathematics (Beginner-Friendly)

Now that we know how to create a ray, let's figure out where it hits objects in our 3D world. We'll break down each object type step by step, using simple analogies and examples.

## 1. Sphere Intersection: The Complete Derivation

### What is a Sphere?
A **sphere** is like a ball: every point on its surface is exactly the same distance from its center. For example, a sphere with center (2, 3, 4) and radius 5 means every point on the sphere is 5 units away from (2, 3, 4).

### Sphere Equation Derivation
**Distance formula** between two points P and C:
```
distance = √[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²]
```

For a sphere, this distance equals the radius:
```
√[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²] = r
```

**Square both sides** to eliminate the square root:
```
(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)² = r²
```

**Vector notation**: If P is position and C is center, then (P-C) is vector from center to point:
```
|P - C|² = r²
```

### Ray-Sphere Intersection Derivation
**The question:** Where does ray R(t) = O + t×D hit the sphere?

**Step 1:** Substitute the ray equation into sphere equation
```
|R(t) - C|² = r²
|(O + t×D) - C|² = r²
|(O - C) + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 2:** Let oc = O - C (vector from sphere center to ray origin)
```
|oc + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 3:** Expand the squared magnitude
The magnitude squared |A|² means A·A (dot product with itself):
```
(oc + t×D)·(oc + t×D) = r²
```

**Step 4:** Expand the dot product using distributive property
```
oc·oc + oc·(t×D) + (t×D)·oc + (t×D)·(t×D) = r²
```

**Step 5:** Simplify using dot product properties
- Dot product is commutative: oc·(t×D) = (t×D)·oc
- Scalar can move outside: (t×D)·(t×D) = t²×(D·D)
```
oc·oc + 2t×(oc·D) + t²×(D·D) = r²
```

**Step 6:** Rearrange into standard quadratic form At² + Bt + C = 0
```
(D·D)t² + 2(oc·D)t + (oc·oc - r²) = 0
```

**The coefficients are:**
- **a = D·D** (usually = 1 since D is normalized)
- **b = 2(oc·D)** 
- **c = oc·oc - r²**

### Solving the Quadratic Equation
**Standard formula:** For At² + Bt + C = 0, solutions are:
```
t = (-B ± √(B² - 4AC)) / 2A
```

**The discriminant Δ = B² - 4AC tells us:**
- **Δ < 0**: No real solutions (ray misses sphere)
- **Δ = 0**: One solution (ray touches sphere at one point)
- **Δ > 0**: Two solutions (ray enters and exits sphere)

**Optimization insight:** We can check if B² < 4AC before doing expensive √ calculation!

### Computing the Surface Normal
**At intersection point P, the normal is:**
```
N = normalize(P - C)
```

**Why?** The normal is the direction pointing "outward" from the sphere surface. Since every point on a sphere is the same distance from center, the outward direction is simply (point - center).

**Direction check:** Make sure normal points away from the ray:
```
if N·D > 0:  // dot product positive means same direction
    N = -N   // flip it
```

## 2. Plane Intersection: Simple Linear Mathematics

### What is a Plane?
A **plane** is a flat surface extending infinitely in all directions. Think of:
- A tabletop extended forever
- A wall that goes on infinitely
- The floor of a room, but infinite

### Plane Equation Derivation
**Method 1 - Point and Normal:**
If you know:
- One point P₀ on the plane
- The normal vector N (perpendicular to the plane)

Then any point P is on the plane if:
```
(P - P₀)·N = 0
```

**Why?** (P - P₀) is a vector from the known point to any point on the plane. If this vector is perpendicular to the normal (dot product = 0), then P is on the plane.

### Ray-Plane Intersection Derivation
**Substitute ray equation R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
((O + t×D) - P₀)·N = 0
(O - P₀ + t×D)·N = 0
(O - P₀)·N + t×(D·N) = 0
```

**Solve for t:**
```
t×(D·N) = -(O - P₀)·N
t×(D·N) = (P₀ - O)·N
t = (P₀ - O)·N / (D·N)
```

**Special cases:**
- **If D·N ≈ 0:** Ray is parallel to plane (no intersection or infinite intersections)
- **If t < 0:** Intersection is behind the ray origin (not visible)
- **If t ≥ 0:** Valid intersection at distance t

## 3. Cylinder Intersection: Projections and Quadratics

### Understanding Cylinders
A **cylinder** is like a circle "stretched" along an axis:
- **Infinite cylinder:** Like a pipe extending forever in both directions
- **Finite cylinder:** Like a actual pipe with top and bottom caps

### The Mathematical Challenge
**Problem:** A cylinder isn't centered at origin and isn't aligned with coordinate axes.

**Solution:** Use vector projections to work in "cylinder coordinates."

### Cylinder Equation Derivation
**For infinite cylinder:**
- **Axis:** Line through point C in direction V (normalized)
- **Radius:** r

**Key insight:** Distance from any point P to the axis line must equal r.

**Step 1:** Find vector from axis point C to our point P:
```
CP = P - C
```

**Step 2:** Project this vector onto the axis to find the "axis component":
```
axis_component = (CP·V) × V
```
This is how much of CP goes along the axis direction.

**Step 3:** The remaining part is perpendicular to axis:
```
perpendicular_component = CP - axis_component
                       = (P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V
```

**Step 4:** For a point to be on cylinder, perpendicular distance = radius:
```
|perpendicular_component|² = r²
|(P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

### Ray-Cylinder Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
|(O + t×D - C) - ((O + t×D - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Let X = O - C:**
```
|(X + t×D) - ((X + t×D)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Expand the dot product:**
```
(X + t×D)·V = X·V + t×(D·V)
```

**Substitute back:**
```
|(X + t×D) - (X·V + t×(D·V)) × V|² = r²
|X + t×D - (X·V)×V - t×(D·V)×V|² = r²
|X - (X·V)×V + t×(D - (D·V)×V)|² = r²
```

**Define simplified vectors:**
```
a = D - (D·V)×V    // direction component perpendicular to axis
b = X - (X·V)×V    // origin offset perpendicular to axis
```

**The equation becomes:**
```
|b + t×a|² = r²
(b + t×a)·(b + t×a) = r²
b·b + 2t×(a·b) + t²×(a·a) = r²
```

**Rearrange to quadratic form:**
```
(a·a)t² + 2(a·b)t + (b·b - r²) = 0
```

### Finite Cylinder: Height Constraints
**After finding intersection point P, check:**
```
height_along_axis = (P - C)·V
if 0 ≤ height_along_axis ≤ cylinder_height:
    valid intersection
```

## 4. Cone Intersection: The Most Complex Case

### Understanding Cones
A **cone** is like a circle that gets smaller as you move along an axis:
- **Apex:** The pointy tip
- **Axis:** The direction the cone points
- **Angle:** How "wide" the cone opens (half-angle from axis to surface)

### Cone Equation Derivation
**Key insight:** At any point P on the cone, the angle between (P - Apex) and Axis equals the cone's half-angle.

**Using dot product to measure angles:**
```
cos(angle) = (A·B) / (|A| × |B|)
```

**For cone with apex A, axis V, and half-angle θ:**
```
cos(θ) = ((P - A)·V) / |P - A|
```

**Rearrange:**
```
((P - A)·V) = |P - A| × cos(θ)
```

**Square both sides:**
```
((P - A)·V)² = |P - A|² × cos²(θ)
```

### Ray-Cone Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D, let X = O - A, m = cos(θ):**
```
((X + t×D)·V)² = |X + t×D|² × m²
```

**Expand left side:**
```
(X·V + t×(D·V))² = (X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)²
```

**Expand right side:**
```
|X + t×D|² × m² = (X·X + 2t×(D·X) + t²×(D·D)) × m²
                 = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Set equal and rearrange:**
```
(X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)² = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Collect terms by powers of t:**
```
[(D·V)² - m²×(D·D)]t² + 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]t + [(X·V)² - m²×(X·X)] = 0
```

**Final quadratic coefficients:**
- **a = (D·V)² - m²×(D·D)**
- **b = 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]**  
- **c = (X·V)² - m²×(X·X)**

### Optimization: Precomputed Constants
**Instead of recalculating trigonometric functions:**
```c
typedef struct {
    double cos_angle = cos(θ/2);      // Calculate once
    double sin_angle = sin(θ/2);      // Calculate once  
    double cos_angle_sq = cos²(θ/2);  // Calculate once
    double tan_half_angle = tan(θ/2); // Calculate once
} cone_constants;
```

**Performance gain:** ~25-30% faster because trigonometric functions are expensive!

# Lighting & Shadows (Simple Explanations)

Now that we know where our ray hits objects, let's figure out how to make them look realistic with lighting and shadows. We'll break down each idea step by step, using simple analogies and examples.

## 1. The Phong Lighting Model

### What is the Phong Lighting Model?
The Phong lighting model is a way to make 3D objects look realistic by simulating how light behaves. It combines three types of light:

- **Ambient Light**: Like the general light in a room. Even in shadow, objects aren't completely black because light bounces off walls, ceiling, etc.
- **Diffuse Light**: Like sunlight hitting your face. The more directly the light hits the surface, the brighter it is.
- **Specular Light**: Like a shiny highlight on a polished surface. (We won't cover this in our basic version.)

## 2. Ambient Lighting

### What is Ambient Light?
Ambient light is the general light that fills a room. It doesn't come from any one place—it's like the light that bounces around everywhere.

### How Do We Calculate Ambient Light?
We use a simple formula:
```
I_ambient = ambient_ratio × ambient_color × object_color
```

**Example:**
- If ambient light is 20% white (ambient_ratio = 0.2) and the object is red (object_color = (1, 0, 0)), then:
  ```
  I_ambient = 0.2 × (1, 1, 1) × (1, 0, 0) = (0.2, 0, 0)  // dark red
  ```

## 3. Diffuse Lighting (Lambertian Reflection)

### What is Diffuse Light?
Diffuse light is the light that hits a surface directly. The brightness depends on the angle between the surface normal and the light direction.

### The Physics
- If light hits the surface head-on (perpendicular), it's brightest.
- If light hits at a shallow angle, it's dimmer.

### Lambert's Law
We use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the light direction:
```
brightness ∝ cos(angle_between_normal_and_light)
```

### Complete Diffuse Formula
```
I_diffuse = light_intensity × light_color × object_color × max(0, N·L) × attenuation
```

**Why max(0, N·L)?** If the dot product is negative, the light is hitting the back side of the surface (should be dark).

## 4. Distance Attenuation

### What is Attenuation?
Attenuation is how light gets dimmer as it travels farther. Think of a flashlight: the farther you are, the dimmer the light.

### Mathematical Model
We use this formula:
```
attenuation = 1 / (1 + kl×d + kq×d²)
```

Where:
- **d** = distance to light
- **kl** = linear attenuation coefficient (e.g., 0.01)
- **kq** = quadratic attenuation coefficient (e.g., 0.001)

**Why this formula?**
- Close to the light (d ≈ 0): attenuation ≈ 1 (full brightness)
- Far from the light (large d): attenuation ≈ 0 (very dim)
- The linear + quadratic terms give a realistic falloff.

## 5. Shadows

### What is a Shadow?
A shadow is a dark area where light is blocked by an object. In raytracing, we check if there's anything between the surface point and the light source.

### How Do We Check for Shadows?
1. Cast a "shadow ray" from the surface point toward the light.
2. If the shadow ray hits any object before reaching the light, the surface is in shadow.

### Shadow Ray Setup
```
shadow_origin = hit_point + ε × light_direction
shadow_direction = light_direction
```

**Why add ε (epsilon)?** Without it, the shadow ray might immediately hit the same surface it started from due to floating-point precision errors (called "shadow acne").

### Shadow Test Algorithm
```
if shadow_ray_hits_any_object AND distance_to_hit < distance_to_light:
    point is in shadow (no direct light)
else:
    point is illuminated (add diffuse lighting)
```

## 6. Putting It All Together

### Final Lighting Formula
```
final_color = I_ambient + I_diffuse
```

**Example:**
- If ambient light is (0.2, 0, 0) and diffuse light is (0.5, 0, 0), then:
  ```
  final_color = (0.2, 0, 0) + (0.5, 0, 0) = (0.7, 0, 0)  // bright red
  ```

---

# Performance Optimization (Beginner-Friendly)

Now that we know how to create rays, find intersections, and calculate lighting, let's talk about how to make our raytracer faster. We'll break down each optimization step by step, using simple analogies and examples.

## 1. Early Ray Termination

### What is Early Ray Termination?
Early ray termination means stopping the search for intersections as soon as we find a very close hit. It's like finding the closest person in a crowd—once you find someone right in front of you, you don't need to look further.

### How Does It Work?
- If we find an intersection at a very small distance (e.g., less than 0.002 units), we can stop searching.
- This saves time because we don't need to check objects that are farther away.

### Example:
```
if hit_found AND closest_distance < EARLY_TERMINATION_DISTANCE:
    break  // Stop searching
```

## 2. Sphere Discriminant Optimization

### What is the Discriminant?
The discriminant is part of the quadratic formula used to find where a ray hits a sphere. It tells us if the ray hits the sphere at all.

### How Do We Optimize It?
- Calculating the square root (√) is expensive.
- We can check if the discriminant is negative before doing the expensive calculation.
- If the discriminant is negative, the ray misses the sphere.

### Example:
```
if b² < 4ac:
    return no_intersection  // Skip expensive sqrt calculation
```

## 3. Cone Constant Precomputation

### What is Precomputation?
Precomputation means calculating values once and reusing them, instead of calculating them every time.

### How Do We Precompute Cone Constants?
- For a cone, we need values like cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2), and tan(θ/2).
- Instead of calculating these every time a ray hits the cone, we calculate them once when the cone is created.

### Example:
```c
typedef struct {
    double cos_angle = cos(θ/2);      // Calculate once
    double sin_angle = sin(θ/2);      // Calculate once  
    double cos_angle_sq = cos²(θ/2);  // Calculate once
    double tan_half_angle = tan(θ/2); // Calculate once
} cone_constants;
```

**Performance gain:** ~25-30% faster because trigonometric functions are expensive!

# Numerical Considerations (Floating-Point for Beginners)

Now that we've covered the main parts of raytracing, let's talk about a tricky topic: floating-point numbers. Don't worry—we'll break it down into simple ideas!

## Why Floating-Point is Tricky

### What are Floating-Point Numbers?
Floating-point numbers are how computers store decimal numbers (like 3.14 or 0.001). But they aren't perfect—they can't represent some numbers exactly.

### Examples of Floating-Point Quirks
- **0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004** (not exactly 0.3!)
- Very small numbers can become zero.
- Very large numbers can lose precision.

**Analogy:** Think of floating-point numbers like a ruler with tiny marks. You can measure 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, but not exactly 1.15—it might be 1.149999 or 1.150001.

## Epsilon Values and Their Purposes

### What is Epsilon?
Epsilon is a tiny number we use to say "close enough" when comparing floating-point numbers. It helps us avoid errors caused by tiny rounding differences.

### Common Epsilon Values
```
EPSILON = 1e-4        // General "close enough" comparisons
MIN_T = 1e-3          // Minimum ray distance (avoid hitting starting surface)
SHADOW_EPSILON = 1e-6 // Shadow ray offset (smaller for more precision)
```

### Choosing Epsilon Values
- **Too small:** Precision errors cause problems (like "shadow acne").
- **Too large:** Miss valid intersections or create gaps.

**Analogy:** Epsilon is like a small margin of error. If two numbers are within this margin, we consider them equal.

## Safe Floating-Point Comparisons

### Wrong Way
```
if (a == b)  // Almost never true for floating-point!
```

### Right Way
```
if (fabs(a - b) < EPSILON)  // Close enough to be considered equal
```

**Example:**
- If a = 0.1 + 0.2 (≈ 0.30000000000000004) and b = 0.3, then:
  ```
  fabs(a - b) = fabs(0.30000000000000004 - 0.3) = 0.00000000000000004
  ```
  Since 0.00000000000000004 < EPSILON, we consider a and b equal.

# Hands-On Exercises & Examples

Now that we've covered the theory, let's put it into practice! Here are some simple exercises to help you understand raytracing better. Each exercise includes a step-by-step solution and a code example.

## Exercise 1: Understanding 3D Coordinates

**Goal:** Visualize 3D coordinate system and understand point representation.

**Problem:** Given these points, describe where they are in 3D space:
- A = (0, 0, 0)
- B = (1, 0, 0)  
- C = (0, 1, 0)
- D = (0, 0, 1)
- E = (1, 1, 1)
- F = (-1, 2, -0.5)

**Solution:**
```
A = Origin (center of coordinate system)
B = 1 unit to the right of origin
C = 1 unit above origin  
D = 1 unit in front of origin (positive Z)
E = Corner of unit cube (right, up, forward)
F = Left of origin, above origin, behind origin
```

**Practical Implementation:**
```c
// Visualize points by printing their distances from origin
void print_point_info(t_point3 p, char *name) {
    double distance = sqrt(p.x*p.x + p.y*p.y + p.z*p.z);
    printf("Point %s: (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f) - Distance from origin: %.2f\n", 
           name, p.x, p.y, p.z, distance);
}

// Test it
t_point3 points[] = {
    {0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, 
    {0, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {-1, 2, -0.5}
};
char *names[] = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"};

for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    print_point_info(points[i], names[i]);
}
```

## Exercise 2: Basic Vector Operations

**Goal:** Master fundamental vector arithmetic.

**Problem:** Given vectors A = (3, 4, 0) and B = (1, -2, 5), calculate:
1. A + B
2. A - B  
3. 2 × A
4. Length of A
5. A · B (dot product)
6. A × B (cross product)

**Solution:**
```
1. A + B = (3+1, 4+(-2), 0+5) = (4, 2, 5)
2. A - B = (3-1, 4-(-2), 0-5) = (2, 6, -5)
3. 2 × A = (2×3, 2×4, 2×0) = (6, 8, 0)
4. |A| = √(3² + 4² + 0²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5
5. A · B = 3×1 + 4×(-2) + 0×5 = 3 - 8 + 0 = -5
6. A × B = (4×5 - 0×(-2), 0×1 - 3×5, 3×(-2) - 4×1) = (20, -15, -10)
```

**Practical Implementation:**
```c
void test_vector_operations(void) {
    t_vector3 a = {3, 4, 0};
    t_vector3 b = {1, -2, 5};
    
    printf("Vector A: (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", a.x, a.y, a.z);
    printf("Vector B: (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", b.x, b.y, b.z);
    
    t_vector3 sum = vector3_add(a, b);
    printf("A + B = (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", sum.x, sum.y, sum.z);
    
    t_vector3 diff = vector3_subtract(a, b);
    printf("A - B = (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", diff.x, diff.y, diff.z);
    
    t_vector3 scaled = vector3_scale(a, 2.0);
    printf("2 × A = (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", scaled.x, scaled.y, scaled.z);
    
    double length = vector3_length(a);
    printf("|A| = %.1f\n", length);
    
    double dot = vector3_dot(a, b);
    printf("A · B = %.1f\n", dot);
    
    t_vector3 cross = vector3_cross(a, b);
    printf("A × B = (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", cross.x, cross.y, cross.z);
}
```

## Exercise 3: Understanding Dot Product Geometry

**Goal:** Understand what dot product tells us about angle between vectors.

**Problem:** Calculate the angle between these vector pairs:
1. A = (1, 0, 0) and B = (0, 1, 0)
2. A = (1, 1, 0) and B = (1, -1, 0)  
3. A = (2, 0, 0) and B = (-3, 0, 0)

**Theory:**
```
cos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| × |B|)
θ = arccos((A · B) / (|A| × |B|))
```

**Solution:**
```
1. A · B = 1×0 + 0×1 + 0×0 = 0
   |A| = 1, |B| = 1
   cos(θ) = 0/(1×1) = 0 → θ = 90° (perpendicular)

2. A · B = 1×1 + 1×(-1) + 0×0 = 1 - 1 = 0  
   |A| = √2, |B| = √2
   cos(θ) = 0/(√2×√2) = 0 → θ = 90° (perpendicular)

3. A · B = 2×(-3) + 0×0 + 0×0 = -6
   |A| = 2, |B| = 3  
   cos(θ) = -6/(2×3) = -1 → θ = 180° (opposite directions)
```

**Practical Implementation:**
```c
double vector_angle_degrees(t_vector3 a, t_vector3 b) {
    double dot = vector3_dot(a, b);
    double len_a = vector3_length(a);
    double len_b = vector3_length(b);
    
    double cos_theta = dot / (len_a * len_b);
    cos_theta = fmax(-1.0, fmin(1.0, cos_theta)); // Clamp for numerical stability
    
    double theta_radians = acos(cos_theta);
    return theta_radians * 180.0 / M_PI; // Convert to degrees
}

void test_vector_angles(void) {
    t_vector3 pairs[][2] = {
        {{1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}},
        {{1, 1, 0}, {1, -1, 0}},
        {{2, 0, 0}, {-3, 0, 0}}
    };
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        double angle = vector_angle_degrees(pairs[i][0], pairs[i][1]);
        printf("Angle %d: %.1f degrees\n", i+1, angle);
    }
}
```

## Exercise 4: Cross Product and Perpendicular Vectors

**Goal:** Understand how cross product creates perpendicular vectors.

**Problem:** Given A = (1, 0, 0) and B = (0, 1, 0), find vector C that is perpendicular to both.

**Theory:** C = A × B gives a vector perpendicular to both A and B.

**Solution:**
```
C = A × B = (1, 0, 0) × (0, 1, 0)
  = (0×0 - 0×1, 0×0 - 1×0, 1×1 - 0×0)
  = (0, 0, 1)
```

**Verification:** C should be perpendicular to both A and B:
```
C · A = (0, 0, 1) · (1, 0, 0) = 0×1 + 0×0 + 1×0 = 0 ✓
C · B = (0, 0, 1) · (0, 1, 0) = 0×0 + 0×1 + 1×0 = 0 ✓
```

**Practical Implementation:**
```c
void test_cross_product_perpendicularity(void) {
    t_vector3 a = {1, 0, 0};
    t_vector3 b = {0, 1, 0};
    t_vector3 c = vector3_cross(a, b);
    
    printf("A = (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", a.x, a.y, a.z);
    printf("B = (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", b.x, b.y, b.z);
    printf("C = A × B = (%.1f, %.1f, %.1f)\n", c.x, c.y, c.z);
    
    double dot_ca = vector3_dot(c, a);
    double dot_cb = vector3_dot(c, b);
    
    printf("C · A = %.6f (should be ~0)\n", dot_ca);
    printf("C · B = %.6f (should be ~0)\n", dot_cb);
    
    if (fabs(dot_ca) < 1e-10 && fabs(dot_cb) < 1e-10) {
        printf("✓ C is perpendicular to both A and B!\n");
    }
}
```

# Advanced Topics

In this section, we'll explore some advanced topics in raytracing that build upon the foundational concepts we've covered so far. These topics include ray-object intersection, shading models, and optimization techniques.

## Ray-Object Intersection

**Goal:** Understand how to determine if a ray intersects with an object in 3D space.

**Problem:** Given a ray with origin O and direction D, and a sphere with center C and radius R, determine if the ray intersects the sphere.

**Theory:**
The ray-sphere intersection can be determined by solving the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 \cdot (D \cdot D) + 2t \cdot (D \cdot (O - C)) + (O - C) \cdot (O - C) - R^2 = 0
\]
where \( t \) is the parameter along the ray.

**Solution:**
1. Calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   \Delta = (2 \cdot (D \cdot (O - C)))^2 - 4 \cdot (D \cdot D) \cdot ((O - C) \cdot (O - C) - R^2)
   \]
2. If \(\Delta < 0\), the ray does not intersect the sphere.
3. If \(\Delta = 0\), the ray is tangent to the sphere.
4. If \(\Delta > 0\), the ray intersects the sphere at two points.

**Practical Implementation:**
```c
bool ray_sphere_intersection(t_point3 O, t_vector3 D, t_point3 C, double R, double *t) {
    t_vector3 OC = vector3_subtract(O, C);
    double a = vector3_dot(D, D);
    double b = 2.0 * vector3_dot(D, OC);
    double c = vector3_dot(OC, OC) - R * R;
    double discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c;

    if (discriminant < 0) {
        return false; // No intersection
    }

    double t1 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2.0 * a);
    double t2 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2.0 * a);

    if (t1 > 0) {
        *t = t1;
        return true;
    } else if (t2 > 0) {
        *t = t2;
        return true;
    }
