# miniRT Parser Capabilities

## Handled Edge Cases

The miniRT parser now handles the following edge cases and error conditions:

### File and Format Validation
- Invalid file extensions (must be .rt)
- Empty files or files with only comments/whitespace
- Files without required elements (ambient lighting, camera)
- Files with only invalid elements

### Token and Syntax Validation
- Invalid token counts for each element type
- Detailed error messages for format requirements
- Handling of unknown element identifiers
- Detection of duplicate unique elements (ambient, camera)

### Numeric Value Validation
- Range checking for ratios (0.0-1.0)
- Range checking for colors (0-255)
- Detection of negative values for dimensions
- Check for FOV range (0-180 degrees)
- Validation of normalized vectors
- Detection of zero vectors where not allowed

### Scene Structure Validation
- Maximum object count enforcement
- Maximum light count enforcement
- Requirement for at least one object
- Required presence of ambient and camera

### Rendering-related Validation (Warnings)
- Detection of extremely small object dimensions
- Detection of extremely large object dimensions
- Check for camera being inside objects
- Detection of lights very close to camera
- Check for objects very far from origin
- Detection of very small vector components

### Memory Management
- Proper allocation and freeing of resources
- Handling of memory allocation failures
- Cleanup on error conditions

## Parser Architecture
- Clean separation of parsing, validation, and utility functions
- Modular design with one file per functional area
- Clear error reporting with specific messages
- Robust against malformed input

## Future Improvements
- Support for more primitives (cones, triangles)
- More sophisticated validation of scene semantics
- Better handling of floating point precision issues
- Support for texture and material properties
